15557,,True,[deleted],,,,"Why do you want to be like everyone else?.. Maybe you need to envision your own path. With low self esteem its easy to just want to be normal. Because its easier to see that idea/goal than whet you believe you could be. With no self esteem we get caught in a blindness that doesn't allow us to see what we dream of, or what we want to be.

The sad thing about being normal, is that it doesn't make thing better. That comes from a way of seeing the world as a grateful and patient way. To be happy it has to mainly come from within.

Sounds like the way you are chasing after love is backwards to actually getting it. Love is free. But because you grasp at love, you will become a black hole when feeling that emotion. You need to find a way to radiate that so you can receive it properly. Even if it starts out small.

Fingers man, I can get a woman off better with my fingers than my own cock. To please a woman sexually is more than banging her brains out, its emotions and her hole body being accepted, and yes sex. Fingers play confidence is a great backup, by having and understanding of it, it eases pressure when it comes to ""preforming""

Get some exercise as well, you seem like a lazy piece of shit. Fucking walk to music, ride a bike, something. It doesn't take much to go for a brisk walk, or slow run.

your best bet as everyones suggested would be going to your GP, im going to assume you've already registered with your local hospital in your  uni area, if not you'll need to go in house and fill out a registration form before you'll be able to make an appointment, otherwise phone them and make an appointment. 

Incidentally if you feel like your struggling to cope at uni, it could be worth getting into contact with your personal tutor and asking about an ""interrupt"" or anything else they could do to support you. 

And The Samaritans UK can be... I was going to say its a helpful experience, but honestly i've not managed to pluck up the courage to phone them, they do however have an email service which i found comforting. And I know what your thinking, Samaritans are for people in danger of suicide, They do handle those people but they are also more than happy for a confiding conversation.

The way she dumped you and then hooked up with another friend is messed up, and it's very understandable your self-confidence took a serious blow from that. But try not to take it too personally. You say she says her sex life is more active and fulfilling now and you immediatley think your own performance is inadequate. But it takes two people to have a good sex life. If anything was missing whilst the two of you were sleeping together, who says it was 100% your doing? Stop taking these things personal. She made a selfish choice to pursue her happiness in a different way with a different guy. It's time for you to make choices for YOU. Stop seeing her or talking to her, it's not doing you any good. The best way to get over an ex is to break all contact and focus on new things. (I understand she's your neighbour; that still doesn't mean you have to talk to her.

You won't be able to fix your depression by listing all your problems and trying to tackle them all in one go.

12,,True,Sawta,,,,"*There are no true ""tricks"" to get around this problem of yours.  This is something that every person faces.*

I hope that you can find your own way through the advice that I'm giving you.

1) This actually what a lot of people go through.  Sure, it's annoying, but it gets easier as you get older.  With myself, I only became a much more sociable person after I lost several people who I was close to, and closed everyone else out for a very long time (two or three years).  It was only after that point that I started to understand how short life really is, and that (I know this line is cheesy, and used far too much, but) I shouldn't particularly care what others think of me, as long as I'm doing something that I like to do.

You can choose to do what makes everyone else happy, and serve their needs, or you can break away from what others expect you to do and say, make a lasting impression on people around you and be comfortable with who you are.  Just don't waste any more time doing things that don't bring you happiness.

2) Try to avoid self-help books.  They are, for the most part, complete horseshit.  Treat, and speak to people the way you imagine that people want to be treated.  If that fails, no great loss.  Try again with them; if they tune you out completely, start new with someone else.  

3) Do not expect to have any particularly meaningful (or even exciting) relationships in High School.  I'm sure that *some* people do, and have tons of fun, love each other well into their late 80's, etc. etc.  Not everyone is that lucky.

4) A general guide on how to loosen up around strangers: The best things that I've found that will help myself become more sociable with people is this: Realize that many, *many* people that you meet throughout your life will have exactly the same anxieties that you do.  You are not special.  You are not some several broken freak or mentally defective in some way.  You posses the same basic abilities that every other person has who chooses to put themselves out there regardless of the ""consequences"".  The only difference between the two of you is that you are still worried about the results.

Give into your worst social scenarios, and you'll find out that things wont be nearly as bad as you imagine them to  be.

5) Make a point to (almost) **never** focus on negative parts of your life, body, personality, past/present/future relationships, etc.

The *only* things it will do to conversations is this: annoy anyone who has to listen to it for hours on end, get really tedious *really* quickly, and make it incredibly difficult/awkward to have an interesting conversation someone as a result.  I'm sure if you think hard enough, you can think of at least two or *three* people who will do this to themselves on a daily basis.

If people are completely uninterested in what you are saying, just say something stupid or interesting (it can literally be the first thing that comes to your mind, or something as trivial as satiating that you don't think that they are interested in what you're talking about. *example(s): ""Purple monkey dishwasher!!"" ""If you have a sex change from a man to a woman, then have sex with a women, does that make you straight or gay?"", ""[If you could choose invisibility or flight, which would you choose, and why?](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=178)"", ""Some times I get so angry I could...I COULD JUST PUNCH A BABY!"", ""Why do we put on such a strong face and make busy work for ourselves as a distraction from what life fully has to offer us?  Are we all so incredibly terrified of what lies beyond this life that we can't even bother to face reality while we have the chance?"").  If you can get a laugh out of them, a response or at least an odd stare, you'll know that they are at least partly paying attention to what you are saying.

**tl;dr** Do not expect things that you desire to be easily attainable.  If you do not set, and work hard towards personal goals, you should not be surprised at your results.",,0.0,,2009-01-01 06:15:54,,,0,True,,,,0,,802k,,,,,t3_7mqyx,,,t1_802k,,,,t3_7mqyx,,,,,,,,1428222175.0,,6,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,6,,

I'll elaborate below.

First, it's important to know that I have something that a lot of people my age don't have-- tons of freedom and the privilege of doing whatever I want for most of my day on a regular basis. Yay! Sounds awesome, right?

Let's sprinkle a little severe depression on top of that, with a side of anxiety and the untimely deaths of those closest to you, and then see how awesome it is.

* See how awesome it is to go get a pizza and have it made slightly differently than you wanted. **Depressed.**

* Have a really bad itch for no reason. **Depressed.**

* Cat doesn't want to play with you. **Depressed.**

* Find out you missed a sale on something you wanted to buy. **Depressed.**

* Computer crashes while you were typing something that's not even really important, and it didn't save. **DE-FUCKIN-PRESSED.**

There is absolutely nothing I can do with my free time, other than lay in the dark doing nothing, that doesn't have the (very high) potential to completely fuck up my day, or sometimes my week.

I find that people tend to judge in this situation, because it's difficult to handle responsibilities when a person goes through this (if things I *like* to do cause me pain, why would I even take a chance on things I *don't* want to do?). It seems quite easy to judge when you're not someone who's constantly surrounded by psychological landmines, even in places that I'd consider ""safe"" or ""comforting."" 

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep and do my best to make sure this doesn't turn into a suicide note.

**EDIT:** Well, that didn't help at all. I have no idea what to do. Not a clue. Everything I do could possibly, and easily, blow up in my face and ravage me psychologically (and this includes anything I'd do to try to *improve* my mood).

Looks like me and the emptiness of oblivion are gonna get to know each other real well. Here's to spending the majority of whatever's left of my life doing absolutely nothing just to keep from having a massive panic attack on a regular basis.

My point is, is that you have that ""twin connection.""  Your brother may be physically gone, but that connection is still there. I hope you are able to take some solace in that fact that you will forever be connected, he is always in your heart, and he is always with you in a way no one ever can be.

This could be the beginnings of depression. Though it doesn't cover all the symptoms and a doctor wouldn't diagnose you probably as depressed. But if you aren't careful. It could turn into something nasty like depression. Trust me, you won't like it. 

Motivation is tricky. I teach kids and I know helping someone else find motivation is tough as nails. It's hard enough finding it for me. 

The only thing I can offer you is two simple steps I use. 

1. One step at a time. Pick one thing a day to focus on. When I think about how much shit I need to do, I get overwhelmed. Freaked out and I get lazy and don't care in a way to protect myself from that anxiety. So I do things one step at a time. Focus on present. Now. What I can do at this moment to help myself.

I know depression is NEVER up to the person who has it. But we all, as people who have and have had it,  that depression creates a view the world that's skewed to make us miserable. It's about perception. I know he can't help how he feels, but with the help of someone, he may be able to change that little by little over time. Rather than seeing him give up and resign himself to this life and this world view, it'd be better to at least TRY to encourage him to fight for every inch and piece of ground. Depression is taxing, draining, and ultimately seems hopeless, but it's it's a fight too. I'm not saying you can beat it with sheer willpower, but there are certain things each of us can do to make an impact.

I was just wondering, what can you do to take your mind off things when you have no idea what there is to do?

If i can talk personally, I'm really looking to get out the house a lot more (I barely leave, and don't have a job right now (I am looking for a new one though)) but there's nothing to do, no reason to actually get out.

 I have very limited funds at the moment, and I can't afford to go to the gym, for example. I'd really like to but it isn't affordable right now. 

There isn't really anything worth exploring where I live either and if there is I've already seen it, plus I don't get much pleasure from taking walks, it's just a way of getting from point to point for me. 

I've considered joining a 'club' of some sort but I don't really have any strong interests in anything, and I wouldn't even know where to look for such a thing, or whether my boring little city even has any. 

I know it sounds like I'm making excuses but people are always saying to 'get out the house' and 'do something' and I'd really like to and I'm fully prepared to do so for the first time in years because I'm sick of being lonely and doing nothing and I'm reaching a dangerous point..... but what exactly can I do? I really want to do something.

I have interests that keeps me occupied at home but it's been getting really stale and i'm just forcing it at this point and definitely need to switch it up.

I'm beginning to think that no one really does care about me accept for one of my great friends. Him and I have been talking, like normal conversations, that take my mind off things. But whenever he isn't around, I'm just left with all my problems and not knowing what to do about them. They're mostly relationship issues that have been taking a toll on me. Things with my parents have been affecting me too. Sorry if I get too into this, I just need to vent.

Okay, so I have been dating this girl for almost 4 months. I waited a decent amount to be with her in the first place. We were talking before we started dating, which also gave me time to connect with her  even more. I went into the relationship with all of my heart, making promises I maybe shouldn't have, but felt like I could keep. I really had a good feeling about being with her, and right now I still do. But lately, it feels like she doesn't care about me as much as she used to. I am very sensitive about things, and I try to get her to understand how I feel about things and why I feel that way about them. In the beginning she respected how I felt about everything and that made me feel really comfortable being with her because she made me think she understood. Recently, we hit a roadblock. We haven't been seeing each other that much and all we do is argue about things that seem to arise when I tell her what is upsetting me. That brings me back to the point that I feel like she doesn't care and maybe I'm just bothering her with all my problems. I tried to maybe spark a new happiness with one simple text message that she could wake up to and think, ""He really loves me and doesn't want anything to happen between us. I love him too, I really do with all my heart."" All she had to say about it was that ""it was nice."" No ""I love you too"" no ""Aww that's really sweet of you"" no nothing, just a simple ""it was nice"". That hit me like a punch in the face. I really thought it would've mean't something to her, and it obviously didn't. Also, she recently changed everything on her Instagram relating to us, including her username. This is what she said, ""I want to change it to match my Tumblr, so more people can find me.""*So more people can find me*. This made me feel like her social networking recognition is more important than our relationship. I told her how I felt about it and at first she I thought she understood me and didn't change it. The next day, I look and she removed everything relating to us. This also hurt me because it made me feel like she didn't care about how I felt. Many other things happened that made me feel like this but I don't want to waste your time for those of you reading this. 

On top of all this, things have been happening with the relationship of my parents and I. They have the idea in their head that I don't want to be with them anymore and I hate being around them, but in reality, I'm just trying to enjoy my summer by hanging out with all my friends. They also think that I don't like to talk about how I feel around them and that I don't trust them. I really do trust them, they're my parents. I love them with all my heart, but they have a hard time believing me.

I really don't know what to do. It feels like my girlfriend doesn't care anymore, and I'm failing as a son. I'm on the verge of just letting everything go, because it seems like the easiest way to escape all the problems I've been faced with. All I'm asking for is guidance.

I posted on r/SuicideWatch about being autistic and feeling ignored, overlooked, and unwanted by men. I wrote that taking a certain drastic step (you know the one) might be the only way to get people to notice me, particularly the guy I've had an obsessive crush on for months. That one song by The Smiths kept running through my head, and I entertained fantasies about people talking about me after I was gone. 

Well, I dragged myself out of the house yesterday, despite my not wanting to do much of anything, and picked up a library flyer on mental health services. Then I read several pages of the engrossing library book I'll have to return soon, got just the right idea for the story revision I've been working on, ate good food at a potluck, and now it's a warm sunny afternoon and I don't feel too bad. 

(It probably helps that today I came across, and responded to, yet another Craigslist post that may have been written by *him.* Of course, it most likely wasn't, but that pesky hope always gives me a little jolt. This has led to a few interesting online conversations.)

I'm a little worried here. Those were some dark thoughts I was having, in a dark place. If I get like this over some dude I've been on *one date* with (after months of communication all initiated by me), what's going to happen when I get into my first real romantic relationship and it ends, as most do?

That sounds like me :\

I think one of the problems is that many people do not understand depression openly.  There are so many factors that go into it.  I'm not saying that I know what everyone's individual situation is, because we're all different.  There are times when I hate myself and there are times when I don't, but I'm almost always depressed.  Sometimes I think it is because of the country I live in (America), or genetics, or the way I was treated in high school (many many years ago, and it still affects me).  Many people seem so mentally strong that I just get angry at them because I do not understand where that comes from and how I can get it, or if I even want it.  Sometimes I think it might be a parasite living in my brain ([toxoplasma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii)).  I don't know the reason, and I really wish I could help, but maybe you'll have some comfort in knowing that you're not alone, and that there is a great big world that doesn't involve emotion at all. (At least, for now, there is a free open internet that I can use to learn as much as I can from without fear of feeling too dumb,  like [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)) and communities like reddit where I can find others who feel similar.

I remember how it all went.  It started with my learning disability diagnosis at the age of 7 and being placed in special ed classes.  I never felt dumb, or unintelligent until I was asked to do puzzles that were meant for kindergartners with kids who could hardly keep the spit in their mouth instead of normal classes.  No one seemed to understand why I felt like I didn't belong there, and it ruined every ounce of self esteem I had. 

Feeling terrible about myself brought on some intense anxiety.  I would have full blown panic attacks when anyone questioned my intelligence or asked me to prove it (test anxiety like WHOA).  Things like if someone asked me read something out loud, I would start shaking, feel like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest, and would get so light headed that I would need to sit down.  This happened at least twice a week for about 3 years until it was almost everyday for about a year.

The anxiety also brought on night terrors.  Often, I would find myself sleep walking (as if trying to get away from something that was after me) or screaming my head of.  Scared my whole family, and made me terrified to go to sleep at night.  I ended up being prescribed Clonidine after I went 3 days without sleeping and started hallucinating on a car ride. 

All of these things resulted in a few suicide attempts as a child (laying in the street, jumping out a trees, riding my bike in traffic).  I got my life together over the years with some help from family and some AMAZING teachers I had over the years.  I had some depression issues over the past 5 or 6 years, but nothing like what I experienced as a child.  Currently, I am in a state of depression and have been for about 4 months now.  Nothing too out of the ordinary for me except for a few things. 

The anxiety and the night terrors are back and I am terrified of what is to come.  I no longer have the same resources that I did back when I was a kid, and I am scared the suicidal thoughts and actions might come back.  Since I have been through this before, I don't think it will result in any actions, but holy fuck am I scared.

Basically, this post is more of a way for me to tell someone that I am scared.  Not really looking for advice, but maybe just someone to say that they have gone through a similar cycle?

Okay, I'm 27 and have never had a relationship. I'm antisocial and currently in school for the second time trying to get a new career after getting canned from my last one after 5 years of being independent. I live in my parents basement now and work part time so as to not go bankrupt. I've moved across the country for this so I've left anyone I can call a friend a few timezones away.

Society expects me to have a family and a house by the time I'm 30 and be well into my career or at least have had a job in the same field for several years.

So by those measures I am and will be a failure. I also find very little joy in things I used to love. I used to have a valid pilots licence and loved flying but now have no motivation. I live everyday and am simply going through the motions most days. Some days are better but my life as a whole is has gone very meh since I graduated college the first round in 2008.

We all know depression is within us.  That it's not about external factors making us sad, its about our brain and how it makes us react and feel.  Even good things can't change our perception that our world might as well be ending.

But the thing is, my brain also tries to rationalize everything.  I try to pick out reasons for why I feel so upset, and then those reasons I've picked out make me feel worse because I obsess over them.  Then I'll start feeling upset over something, and wonder if my depression will worsen because of it.  I'm afraid of things that stress me out or get me worked up.  And I never know what to do because I can't decide what is a legitimate problem in my life and what is one I'm creating just to try and justify my feelings.  It happens almost every day.

One of the most consistent ones is my social life.  I've got a lot of anxiety and it extends to a lot of social situations as well.  I have friends, but I feel that compared to other people my age, I feel pathetic.  I don't go out very often, I have a very small number of people I'm even comfortable asking to hang out, and I am absolutely paranoid about what people think of me.  I have that feeling even with my closest friends and family.  So I struggle to decide whether the solution is to put myself out there more and get more comfortable socially or to accept that I'm just not as social as other people and try to be ok with it.  I honestly don't know which I want.

So I just want to ask...does anyone else have this problem?  Deciding whether to externally or internally deal with your problems?  Trying to figure out if you really are depressed or just using your history with it as a crutch?  I want to believe I can't be controlled by anxiety and depression, and that I can make external changes to make myself happier.

I would rather have a dad punch me in the face and then be sorry about it. I dont care how abusive (well maybe a little bit) he can be, just say sorry and mean it. 

I am also socially akward at school and i make people laugh by making a fool of myself. I never hada girl friend for that reason. I am also really shy about that stuff to. I have been asked out before but i took it as a joke. There is no reason to like me. I also dont have a solid friend to hang out with outside of school.

For me, my two failsafes if nothing else works are reaching out to friends and distraction. 

Reaching out to friends doesn't have to be talking about what's bothering me, it's primarily just a way of engaging different parts of my brain and short circuiting any ruminations or overwhelming feelings I'm having. So I might even just ask someone what they're up to or how they're day has been or ask about their hobby or something I know they're generally interested in and get really engaged in that.

Distraction is exactly what it sounds like. Get up and just do SOMETHING other than what I'm currently doing. Maybe I go to a coffee shop and read, maybe I starting pressing keys randomly on my piano, maybe I watch a movie, maybe I workout, go shop for something, buy a cd, hug a tree, journal, color, paint, draw, make my bed, cook, eat, eat icecream, play video games, do chores, kick a soccer ball around. idk, literally anything that is not what I'm currently doing.

I'm On3Love I am new to this site so please forgive me if my etiquette is not the norm.  I found your post while searching for a thread on the board with no responses.  I was sad to see there are so many posts that go unanswered.  I cannot answer everyone, but it does not mean I cannot try to still help, so I'm starting with you.  I have experienced tragedy early in life and have now come to a place of healing, so I feel the urge to reach out to others who are in a bad place because I know how it feels and have gained another perspective on tragedy and how to use it as way to grow and mature as a person.

Firstly, I'd like to say the story you tell of the your friend in elementary informed me that you are a kind hearted, sensitive, and honorable person.  At the time you did not want to get in trouble and kept your mouth shut, an immature choice that is natural for an elementary student, but your sense of right and wrong was also mature enough to realize you had hurt some one and it deeply affected you.

Now you are older and wiser.  You had the urge to apologize and this would have given you an amount of closure.  Have you tried to look for your friend on Facebook?  You still can apologize if you really want to, it is just not going to be as easy as walking up to him.  You are going to have to search for him.  Luckily, you live on an island so chances are in your favor that he is still around!

Apologizing to him is not the only the way to gain healing and closure.  You realize you made a mistake, and you seem to have learned from it by realizing you never want to do that to another person.  That desire alone was so strong to stop you from speaking.  If you make that desire a conscious part of your everyday interactions, you don't have to stop talking to hurt another.  We are all brothers and sisters in this huge family called humanity.  Speak with others in the way you would speak to a loved sibling.  Some people will reject you because you cannot please everyone, but if you show people the beauty of your heart I promise there will be people who will recognize and appreciate it.  To achieve anything, you must be willing to take a risk, otherwise you will be stuck in the same patterns.

Now for your current friend.  I have more questions than answers.  Have you told him your feelings?  Do you think he would accept you?  If you have not told him yet you should try and predict what his reaction will be.  Can you tell me a bit more about the situation so I can have a better understanding?  You can reply to my personal email if you prefer not to reply publicly.  It is onelove40150@gmail.com

He's now sober for 9 plus years, anyways. My mom had multiple boyfriends, one of them use to steal money from my piggy bank when I was 10 to go buy drugs lol. My mom was a bartender for a long time, ages 7-12 I would be home alone til 2 or 3 am every night. I think I went through child abuse, I remember getting beat a lot as a kid by my mom, and some times her boyfriends, I honestly thought it was normal and every kid went through the same thing. My mom use to spit in my face and tell me I'm useless or say how I ruined her life, but other times she expressed extreme love for me, I think she is bipolar. Currently I don't talk to my dad a lot, maybe 1-2 times a month, he lies a lot and I rather not waste my time with him. I moved a lot as a kid, so any friends I had were quickly lost over time. We had to move once because one of my neighbors was going to call Child protective services lol. All of my neighbors hated my mom. The rest of my family lives in Canada, so realistically, it's only me and my mom.

That's a quick recap of my life, and it doesn't seem too bad compared to other people's stories on this subreddit. I don't even know if the want to kill myself is me being depressed, or me understanding that wasting another 60 or so years is completely pointless. From past experience, I feel like I do more bad than good.

I was given wellbutrin sr 100mg, now I'm on wellbutrin xl 150 mg.  Unfortunately depression and social anxiety runs pretty deep in my family, my great grandmother committed suicide before my dad was even born.  My uncle is nearly crippled by social anxiety, sees a therapist, takes medication, and works night-shift jobs in order to be away from any group of people.  So it's very possible I'll be dealing with depression my whole life.  Lovely.  Anyhoo.

So I've heard wellbutrin makes anxiety worse, and for some reason I always coupled my social anxiety with my depression.  I have a doctors appointment this week to talk about this, but I wanted to hear from others.  Essentially I want to know if it seems like I do have anxiety problems too.  This was part of my post in the ""what does depression feel like"" thread in AskReddit.  
""I knew I was depressed when I would wake up on the weekends at noon (which is normal with my body rhythm for reference, when I naturally wake up) and just roll back over and sleep. Wake up again, force more sleep. Usually till 4. Sometimes to 6, because I just couldn't find any reason to get up. I had things to do, but I didn't care. I probably wouldn't have gotten up at all except my girlfriend would call wanting to go get something to eat. And I felt my roommate was judging me, though he gave no sign. I'm naturally shy, and not much of a people person, which I like actually, and I think my depression expands upon this, to the point I think everyone can see my every fault; see into the depths of my very soul, and they think I'm worthless, a waste of talent. I wish I didn't care what everyone thinks. And in reality I don't. I'm projecting my own negative views of myself onto others, and yet, knowing this, I still feel like everyone is judging me. And so I want to curl up in bed, so that no one can judge me. And play music, what used to allow an escape. Yet I have a roommate, so I can't escape that feeling of being judged. I can't play music, because he is also a musician, and I feel he will judge my music and find me worthless. I can't take action because I can't let anyone else form an opinion. I will never have a roommate again, it fuels the depression.""  

Essentially I don't like meeting or spending time with (new) people.  I need to get a pianist for Double Bass juries, and I've haven't yet because I don't want someone to hear me play and judge my playing.  I haven't made a single new friend in college.  Though it turns out I did pick the wrong college, I hate the classes and (most) people here.  Now as I mentioned I'm naturally shy.  I don't like parties, or large social events, I find them to be pointless.  This is normal and okay in my eyes.  On the other hand I currently started taking Choy Li Fut and Tai Chi classes, so I'm not completely afraid of new things.  I'm just not sure where the line is between normal and anxiety.

My husband has been battling moderate depression for a year and a half and we've been through hell because of it. At first I didn't know what to do. I didn't understand depression. I was angry and upset, I was feeling abandoned and I am textbook borderline so it's been a nightmare for me.  I was awful to him in the beginning, but finally went and saw a therapist who recommended three or four great books, and I changed my mindset and the way I talk to him and things started to look good!

Unfortunately, I didn't change my own nasty attitude and habits before he had an affair. It's been hard and I'm working on the forgiveness, but I understand what my part was in having made him feel emasculated for months, so I wasn't really surprised when I found out.

I can't support both of us on my waitressing salary and since he quit his job and can't/won't find work we've been forced to move out of Manhattan into his mother's house in a nearby suburb.

This is my own personal hell. I had no intention of ever leaving the city and I hate few things more than I hate suburban life. This wasn't part of the plan, but my mother in law wants to help us, so I've learned how to accept help from others, despite how painful that was for me to do also, and now we're living in the burbs.

I've been working this whole time, while he stays home nearly every day and rarely showers. I singlehandedly saved up enough money on my salary alone to finish paying for 3/4 of the trip we started planning two years ago for world cup in Brazil and we had a fantastic time. I do all of the laundry and all of the cooking and all of the errands. I'm exhausted, but any time I ask for him to take something on it turns into a massive fight and I'm made to feel like the worst person in the world for expecting a little help( he's a debate master and I can't win when he's upset. If I want to stop being yelled at for hours after I've stopped arguing, I just have to give him what he wants.) He's been getting better but he still has dozens of triggers and can't control his anger. It's constant egg shells around him. I can't even express in a non judgmental, non aggressive way that this is hard for me and I'm upset and somewhat unhappy here, because he just yells at me to leave then, because he feels totally guilty since he thinks everything bad in the world is his fault.

He's finally all set up to go back to school and finish his history degree and he and I couldn't be more excited! But he may have screwed us both over tonight. He decided to get into a fight with his mom over something stupid and instead of apologizing for coming at her aggressively, he's sticking to his choice to berate her and blame her for just ""not liking the way he said it even if it's true."" I swear, I love him, but sometimes it's like I'm living with a 16 year old instead of a grown ass man. Ugggghhhhh....so, my mother in law (the sweetest, most enabling woman in the whole world) said that if he can't learn how to express himself appropriately, or keep things to himself, then he can't live in her house. So he spent the rest of the night escalating the fight about how his own mother was kicking him out and at the end, essentially made her feel like all he cared about was taking advantage of her(this is his classic move and I've been on the receiving end countless times, because he can feel so guilty about anything that he doubles down and beats people down with his hurtful words). So he is asleep now after then telling me to leave because tomorrow he will be homeless and can't support me, I should get out now, I'm off the hook, I don't even like him, etc. He was also drunk...

I spoke to my mother in law. She's not kicking him or me out. She's very calm, and hopes he feels better in the morning. And I feel bad because I'm happy that now someone else has seen what he's been putting me through..... I'm not crazy! I feel like I've made countless sacrifices, which I'm happy to make in the short-term if it means a long happy marriage after all this. But what on earth am I doing wrong? How should I be talking to him? How should I approach him when he's out of control of his emotions(which is often). What if he never gets better? I don't know if I can keep doing this.

TLDR; The point of all that back story is this: I think it will be ok in the morning, I don't think we'll have to suddenly move out, but how am I supposed to help this man? This is how he fights. He fights for keeps. I don't know what else to do for him and he treats everyone around him like crap then goes and cries himself to sleep. Can someone help me?

All of the gory details below.

I have a 5 month old puppy that I caught chewing on a dead squirrel she found in our yard. She was also chewing some unknown brown stuff she found out there, which I suspect was coyote feces. She suddenly started vomiting and going diarrhea after these incidents late Tuesday/early Wednesday.

I took her in to the vet and she said it would be fine when it passed through her system. Thursday went by and it was still ongoing. I was obligated to go in to work so I had to entrust her care to my parents for most of Thursday. Friday morning comes around and she's still going diarrhea (mostly blood now) so we took her to the pet hospital.

Doctor says they will call us with an update and send us on our way (after paying a huge bill of course). The update wasn't good b/c her liver was failing and her kidneys starting to fail. They got permission from us to do a plasma transfusion to see if that would help. They said they would call again before their shift ended to give another update.

During that time I was busy decontaminating the house from any area with diarrhea or blood and spraying down the pathway in the yard. Doctors suspect is is leptospirosis, and if it is, it is highly contagious to other dogs (we have another 11 yr old dog) and humans.

6 pm rolls around and no update from the doctor so I called in and they tell me the doctor left. This upset me because they forgot to call before they left. Now I have to talk to another doctor who is busy with another emergency. At 8 pm I get a hold of the other doctor and he tells me the bad news. Her liver is still failing - cell degeneration wise, it should be at a 100 but it's at 5,000. Her kidneys have not gotten better or worse since the transfusion. But her glucose levels are stable. If the glucose levels destabilize, she will die. If her liver does not get better in the next 12 hours it's only a matter of time before she dies.

We went to visit her after hearing that, and she was doing okay... she was excited to see us but only wagged her tail a bit because she was weak/tired. Discussed with the doctor and he said we would know for sure by tomorrow morning. The chances don't look too good though. He said it was about a 10% chance, probably less since she's a puppy. It all depends on if they can give her some medication by mouth that will help the liver (usually she vomits if given anything by mouth, so they were hoping she would be stable enough by 2 am to do this).

Mostly I feel guilty for not taking her in to the hospital sooner. I keep thinking that maybe it could have helped... but I was talking to the normal vet throughout Thursday and she said it was okay to wait it out.

Right now it's just a waiting game I guess. I was just feeling frustrated/guilty/depressed about it so I had to write it all out somewhere. There's a thousand more details I could get into but I'm trying not to overthink it so I don't keep blaming myself.

**TL;DR** - My 5 month old puppy that I got to help with my depression probably ate something toxic and now only has a 10% chance she'll live, and it's doing wonders on my depression.

**Update** : We got a call from the doctor this morning saying her kidneys were doing much worse and she suggested we put the puppy to sleep. We went in to see the puppy and she looked way better than last night, more energetic, and happier. The test results actually show a decrease in the liver and other red flags. The new big problem is the kidneys but we asked them to try giving her a diuretic for them. So we are waiting another day to give her another chance.

**Update 2** : All weekend we were monitoring her and we feel its just too cruel to put her to sleep since she is still ""fighting"". Whenever we go to visit her she lights up and gets a bit of energy enough to come to us for a belly rub and wag her tail. The doctors said most dogs would be dead by now pretty much. But her kidneys have completely shut down. The next step is to do dialysis - yes - the kind they do on humans with failing kidneys. That is our last hope. I feel coldhearted but I have accepted that she is not going to make it ever since the doctor told us she wouldn't on Friday night. I stopped paying for the bill because it got too expensive for me at $2500. My dad started picking up the tab and saying we should not give up on her and that there was still hope, even though all the doctors we have seen (4 doctors now) have said she won't make it. My dad is looking at a bill of more than $10000 if he decides to do the dialysis. And for the dialysis we would need to move her to a facility 4 hours away that does this. We are going to meet with a specialist who does internal medicine today to discuss further. It just breaks my heart because they said she started losing more of her baby teeth today and the gums were clotting just fine which means her liver is bouncing back. But her kidneys have not responded to any treatment so far.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,My Puppy is most likely going to die,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2b4d1f/my_puppy_is_most_likely_going_to_die/,

Theres a weird feeling of obligation when youre at a coffee shop or library and everyone else is working. Maybe change your setting, if you can, go to a friends place. For recommendation fear write out your thoughts and terror, and then carefully go back and refute what youve written. Again friends can be a godsend if you cant see the irrationalities. Now i use a bunch of blocking programa for these kind of sites-they are easy to bypass, but the extra step ussually stops me. But we can always find a way to distract ourselves, the most important thing is to take the plunge at all. Commit to 5 minites of applying, and work your way up.

So, here is my story.
I don't know if I'm depressed or not, maybe yes. But well, I just want to share this. Maybe it will feeling me better, if not.. Well... Idc.
I'm 23 years old right now, I only have one more year to finish my master degree in Computer Science. 
I have some friends to be with, that I know they cares about me. So... I'm a regular guy, I think. I'm a bit shy while I'm with new people. 
After that, I can be funny and a guy that people likes to be with.. I think. 
To finish this ""about me"" stuff: I'm a good looking guy too. Not that ugly. Polite, respectful. A good friend also, I think.. :)

About my past:

My parents were divorced since I was a kid, maybe 10 years old. 
My father was working in another country, but we always had a good relationship. We were togheter often. 
I never shared my deep thoughts or feelings, we were never that closed... But well... I know he loved me and I loved him.

I live with my mom and my brother since ever, he is 6 years older than me. I think we always had a good relantionship despite that normal fights when we were kids.
But... Again.. I was never closed to him enough to share my feelings. I think when I started to growing up, we got a bit disconnected from each other. Maybe due to age difference, I dont know...
About my mother, well... I know she loves me, she cares about me, she dedicated all her life to raise both of us, I really appreciate that although I never told him that. 
But well, I don't know why... I'm not very comfortable to talk with her. I know it sounds stupid, she is my mom. I see some of my friends always talking with their moms about everything.
But.. I can't. I don't want to. I don't want to tell her how was my day... What I did, what Im feeling, what I'm gonna do tomorrow. She tries.. And I can see that it hurts her.
Maybe it's the way she speaks with me (she asks a lot of questions, its annoying) or her voice... That makes me upset and unwilling to talk to.

I never had a girlfriend before. Just some ""oneweek"" stand with 3 girls. 
For one way or another, it doenst work. It was not supossed to. I did not suffered with that, it was just something that made me get some experience ehehe.
I had 2 crushes with 2 girls... I suffered a little bit in this case, but well... Right now, Im ok with that. I can see that maybe was the best way.
I had the first crush, that 3 girls, then the last crush. The last was the hardest tbh.

Some months after, I met my first girlfriend.
The next 5 months were the best in my life! I was really happy! I was discovering a new thing, to love someone! Doing a lot of things that couples do togheter.
Going out on dinner, watch movies togheter while we cuddle. Playing games togheter, talk with eachother all night long. Take a walk and visit new places.
The sex was great! Discovering her body and everything with her, it was amazing.
To arrange some surprises to her, you know, the great feeling you have when you make someone happy by your side.
I remember that I was going to sleep with a smile and thinking that, finally, everything is going well in my life! I wanted to be like this forever :)

But... ""Take nothing in your life for granted.""
And the last 3 months were specially hard for me. It all started when my father passed away unexpectedly while he was working abroad.
Someone call me telling the news. I had to tell all my family.
The next two months were really painful and I had the support of my girlfriend more then ever... Or I thought at least. I get too close to her, I had the feeling that I was only happy 
when she was next to me. The rest of the day was really hard to past. My college was harder than ever. I felt such a suffocation in there.
About my girlfriend, I think I became really neady. And, in another way, I think she got tired of me. It's just a feeling. I dont know if it was true.
When I talked with her about that, she said it was ok. She understood that, and I just need to get my shit togheter by myself. Just could help, but nothing more than that.
I should starting to be more time alone, or just going out with my friends. I shouldnt be always around her.

Yes, I did it. And in the last month I thought I was ok again. The college was finally over, that struggle has ended. Now I have time for my self, to relax. To do my things...
Get back to sports (I used to practice jiu jitsu, but well... in this months I miss the ""classes"" a lot. I was tired, I wasnt in the mood..). Going out with friends. To rest and to sleep!

Well, I think I was starting to feeling good again... But not truly. I knew the things with my girlfriend still wasnt ok... I felt she was a bit far away from me. 
She just doesnt care about me anymore. We were like just friends. She doesnt give me her hand or a kiss like before. We didnt have sex. I dont see any effort from her to be around me.
She was always tired from work.. Or she wanted to be with her friends. We didnt go out togheter like before. She doesnt have that desire. We neither watch movies again in bed like before.
Her texts to me were very ""dry"". Like.. Im just a friend. I felt like I was a backup to her. When she got a time or when needed something, she would talk to me.

I talked with her about that. Asked about what was going on between us. She said it was everything in my head. She is the same person since ever. Its her personality to be like that since ever.
Since I was a bit needy like I said, I think maybe she is right, its just a phase. Im overreacting also. Everything its fine, it will be better like before.
And I tried to, instead of being needy, to be the boyfriend I was before. Do my stuff. Be a more relaxed guy. Gave her more space, I started to go back to do my things.

Meanwhile, she fell and got hurt in her back (she lives alone btw), and I take care of her. I helped the most I can. I went with her to the hospital at the middle of the night.
Gave her rides when she needed, so she doesnt need to walk a lot. I cooked for her sometimes or bring dinner for both of us.
Since she couldnt leave home, I was in her place sometimes so she wont feel alone. We went out to eat a icecream, so she can breath some air instead of being closed at home.
For instance, someday, when she got a little better, I abdicated of doing my sport, to go out to dinner and watch a movie on cinema. On a weekend, we went out for a ride to visit an unknown place.
Almost everything were paid by myself in these days, since she doenst have anymore money left in that month. And I dont have a job, since Im still studying.
But Im NOT bothered with that. No way, I would have done everything again. I would take care of her this way, no doubt about that. I love her, I felt good doing all of these! :)

Well.. I thought maybe things are getting well again between us. Im mentally ok after my father's death. Im closed to my girlfriend again. I thought we were both happy!

But... A couple of days after this (last week), she texted me at 1a.m saying that she ""needed some time for herself"". She have ""a strange feeling, like we are just friends, not so close like boyfriends"".
And she ""needs to think about that"". She says she isnt, but in my point of view, she is breaking up with me.
The day after that, I went to her place to get my things back. I dont talk to her since that day.
But she have some more things, I think I will see her again this week.

And well... here I am. Sad. Missing her. Thinking about what she is doing right now...
Thinking why this happened to me? Why I dont have luck on my fucking life. After that crushes, I finally was ok with someone... After my fathers death, I was starting feeling good again!
But not anymore. Why I have no luck... Why me? Why Im feeling depressed in my life so often? Why all bad things happens to me? :(

I was the best boyfriend she could have. I gave her all of me. 
I wasnt a possessive boyfriend. Not a ""controller"" guy. She always could do everything she wants. I am very pacific dude.
I know I shouldnt, but Im here... Like waiting her to come back for me. I dont want to go out, everything remembers me of her. Every place. Every TV show, every music on the radio.

I have my friends, yes.. But.. They could no nothing for me right now. 

I would love to meet new people, maybe new girls to forgive her.. But I dont know how or maybe I dont want to...
Im sleeping all day, crying sometimes. Wishing that she says something to me again. Im feeling depressed again.

Im tired to live my bullshit life. 
I just wanted to have some peace again. Have that feeling againg when I was going to sleep smiling.

First of all, it's not that I don't like you, it's not that I don't care, I'm not bored, it's because I have social anxiety, I've been bullied to the point where I though people didn't want me to speak, I am more observant when I'm quiet, and people don't listen to what I say.

I just wish people would understand that sometimes quiet people won't just magically open up when you tell them to speak.

I became a recluse, staying mostly indoors doing nothing. There often are full days that I don't leave my apartment or meet anybody.

I know it's not healthy, but it's something I've gotten instilled in me since childhood. My problems are my problems and I need to sort them out myself.

Follow up with her right away. When you do, I don't recommend either telling her that it was a mistake, or jumping right into asking to hang out again.

I had unexplained leg pains for years that put me on a couch for weeks at a time (repeated MRIs show nothing at all... plus it took so long to get the appointments that sometimes I wasn't hurting by the time I went in, lots of frustration), various manifestations of depression and chronic fatigue onset about 5 years ago, 2 years ago I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which is a mixed blessing ""Yay I know what's wrong with me!  ... uh oh there's something really wrong with me..."".  The bulk of the hard stuff probably started when I was 16 or so, I'm 29 now, and more or less back in the driver's seat of my life.  There is hope :)

First thing is first... the problems you face are very challenging, and you already recognize that your own ability to solve problems is compromised.  As such, getting outside help is very important, and if you have any way to do it, professional therapy can be a true lifesaver here.  Many of the remedies that help the most involve significant life changes and solving problems you didn't even realize existed.

Tackling the health problems directly can be another big win... I'm a big believer in playing a major role in your own medical care.  Hard problems just get harder when you don't have your own resources in place to solve them.  Also just because the tests come back negative doesn't mean there is nothing wrong.  It may be *that particular* thing is not wrong (even that isn't 100%) but you are certainly struggling with *something*.  You might take a look at something called ""functional medicine"", which aims to more systematically treat the complex chronic conditions like the one you describe.

Medical costs and availability being what they are, I learned most of what I know and utilize from a book: ""The Immune System Recovery Plan"" by Susan Blum.  Some of the most significant suggestions contained within can be (and ultimately have to be) done by yourself anyway, using an elimination diet to see if you have specific food sensitivities, including behaviors in your routine that heal your gut, etc etc.  Elimination diets suck, but if it solves a good chunk of the problems you describe, it will be a huge win.  I don't eat potato of any kind anymore, almost no soda, and sorbitol in particular (which means apples pears and peaches are all out) gives me horrific chest pains within about half an hour of ingestion.

Any further and I will be rambling and maybe I've already gone past the point of being useful here.

(You may need a deposit of $200 or something though -- but if you can take money out of your current account and put it in the new one [without your father's name], then this is what you need to do. When you DO get a job, the money needs to go in your OWN account. Not his. 

I would advise two things you can take advantage of on campus: 
1) psychological services. Even if you don't have insurance, they will usually treat you. I think I paid $125 out of pocket and got to see a therapist and a psychologist who prescribed me prozac. Through the school, my prozac cost $4/bottle. $125 + $4 changed my LIFE. 

2) getting a job on campus. They may not pay you a ton of money, but there is usually a program where you can reduce your tuition and get paid by the school while you work for them. They WILL hire you without any experience. 

Of course, to do both of these things, you need to stay in school. If you can stick it out through the end of the year, then you can look more seriously at loans and scholarships for the next year. In fact, ask your dean about staying in student housing over the summer. There is ALWAYS an exception.

Finally, remember: Cs and Ds make degrees! Your grades can be shit, but you can pull Ds in a lot of your classes and still graduate!

I'm from the US, but since last semester I've been studying abroad very close to my mom's hometown. I've been really introspective lately and analytical of my childhood, family, and how people fit it in. It's just where my mind drifts, because of the current situation I'm in. 

I am an only child, and growing up was pretty lonely. I grew up in a big city, but that didn't really matter. My parents both don't have many friends, and they don't really get along. We didn't have people over at our home a lot, and I always thought it was pretty normal to just do things alone, and not belong to a group of friends. I don't know. It sounds stupid now. I did have friends, but was always really insecure growing up and felt like they I was constantly trying to win their affection, rather than being on an equal basis. 

Like the title says, my mom is from a different country, and my dad is American. I thought it was really cool, but now, after living in that country for half a yr it no longer feels that way. Believe me please when I say this: I did not understand the importance of family until this past year. Like I said, my parents never got along, and really I think despise each other, so after moving here, I have spent a lot of time with my mom's family here. They are a family. They do not always get along, but they do things together. They help out with chores in the house, they eat meals together, they talk about their feelings. For the most part, my childhood wasn't like that. I feel so broken when I see my moms family interacting like that, and it is painful to realize I didn't have that. Also, since moving here, a family friend has invited me to their house a lot, and I also have seen and experienced the bonds that exists in their family, and thinking about that afterwards makes me sick. I feel like I really underdeveloped empathy skills, and just don't know how to belong in a family. You know, ""only child syndrome"", I behave like that. 

Although I've always thought it was cool to be mixed race, I absolutely hate it now. I look like a hybrid kid. Sort of racially ambiguous, and I just feel like I'm not fully anything. I feel like I don't fully belong in my ""home"" city back in the US, and I don't fully belong in my mom's hometown either. I one point just looking at mixed race couples or mixed race kids just made me sick. I just don't understand why you would do that to a kid, if you had the choice not to. I feel like I don't belong to a long, shared line of family history. I just feel like I don't connect to my family's past. I feel like I don't have an identity, and don't have a culture to identify with. Nothing to hold onto, no traditions to carry out. 


I am so ashamed of my parents marriage, and really hate how I don't belong anywhere. I didn't belong in club/group activities in school. My parents never encouraged it, and until now, age 18, I did not see the merit in belonging to a club, group, social circle, what ever. I just feel so outcasted,, and I do not know how to belong in a group. I feel like having good friends requires you to be open about yourself, but I have so much difficulty doing that. Aside from having little experience, I just am so ashamed of myself and childhood and parents that I do not know if I can be open to others.

I'm 22, unemployed, living at home, wasting a degree, and I'm sat here still awake at 5:21am.

I honestly don't believe I have anything going for me right now. I just spent 3 years of my life doing an IT degree, and all I learned is how much I don't want to go into it for a career. What on earth was the point. A piece of paper saying I can do stuff I don't want to do that put me £15k in debt. And I never got any work experience prior to it, so I don't even have experience to put on my CV. Just this stinking degree.

I wish I wasn't back at home. Yes I get on with my mother, but after 3 years away, I massively miss my independence. I was going to move out with my friend who came back from Uni, lives 1 stop on the train away, but as his job hunt goes on, it's looking less likely.

Why can't I find any semblance of motivation to do anything? I just sit at home, feeling sad and sorry for myself, hating how useless I have become, but not doing anything about it. The agency didn't get back to me and subsequently I seem to have just discarded the entire notion. I live off my student loan mostly. Why did I have to have so much left over? Maybe I'd be spurred on if I was desperately low on money.

The only thing that came of it the last few years was a few friends. Sure that's nice, but it makes me realise just how terrible everyone I already knew was. I've known some of these people for the best part of 10 years now. And they never even seem to want to see me. They're too busy with *their* university friends. I thought at first that going away for Uni was good, but seemingly everyone back at home just forgot about me. If I'm lucky, once a month I can see one of my ""closest"" friends, if she ""can be bothered"". I don't even know if I believe the stupidly busy schedule she tells me about anymore. 

Not that the rest of them make up excuses. When I can't even get them to play a game online together, like they do with their other friends, what chance have I got of seeing them in person? There's a growing part of me that just want's to cut them all loose, be done with it and move on. But I can't. I have like, 6 friends that I know in real life. I can't just drop half of them. Can I? Is it their fault I feel like shit? Am I overthinking it all? 

It's been two weeks since I last spoke to one of them. Why don't I just text them? I guess I feel like it's their responsibility to. They fucked me over last time we were meant to meet, and then they told me that they would be busy basically all month.

I remember when I had people I was close to. People I could rely on. People I could talk to. Why can't I open myself up like that anymore? I know some of them are trustworthy, but I've been burnt too many times before. I bottle it all up. They'd understand I'm sure. They can see what's going on better than I can put in words on here. But I can't. I'm too scared. I don't want them to think of me like they would. I don't want to burden them with it. I don't want to be a burden.

I've always thought that I wouldn't have any grievances if I died tomorrow. No regrets. I still believe it. Sure I don't want to die, I don't plan to kill myself, but if I fell ill and told I had a week to live, I think I'd jump straight to acceptance. Enough of this bullshit. Simple.

I have this one good thing in my life. One source of inspiration that my whole mental being rests on, and I'm worried that I'll lose it. That it's just too fragile. For now, I cling to it like a raft, hoping it will see me through.

Some will provide healthcare for as little as a couple dollars a visit and while they are usually staffed by students, those students are already pretty far into their education and are constantly supervised so you actually get multiple psychologists for the price of 1/10 a normal visit.

You should also look for local support groups for depression and or abused victims. If there are none available, use Google, I am sure there are dozens of online support groups.

I know your struggle all too well.  I actually received herpes from my rapist.  Every time I would worry, I would have an outbreak.  Every outbreak became a trigger, and made me worried again.  A vicious cycle. Play it safe, and give yourself time.  You have to remember that you are important.  Learn to appreciate yourself for who you are.   

Every time you have to tell a partner, or talk about it in general, it gets a little easier.  At first I wanted to puke when I had to tell my first partner after the assaults.  Nor was I getting helpful advice from psychiatrists.  They did not know what to say or do.  So I am kicking it's ass on my own.

8890,,True,[deleted],,,,"Please understand, I don't mean this as an attack or to just harp against religion. But I feel you underestimate the effect of religion on our minds.

You defend your faith by saying it has helped you, out of tough spots, eased loneliness, and helped forgive yourself in difficult situations. The problem I have with claims like these, it that the solutions aren't real, its only your imagination. So instead of finding real actions, way of thinking, or a way of living to solve these problems, you went with religion. 

As far as helping you out of hard spots, I think a natural positive way of  thinking could have done the same. To help support your mindset, you didn't fix the problem, But instead you crated a crutch for your mind, to help support it.

Eased loneliness, I would say joining any charity that helps people around town would be better for you. (homeless, food charities, visiting sick at hospitals) 

Helped forgive you in difficult situations, I would say just knowing your human and are prone to mistakes would do the same. There is no need to be forgiven besides the parties involved. The understanding for a godlike forgiveness, is counter productive to a natural state, it is a state dependent on a church or religion.


All I am saying is that the use of faith is like the use of imagination. Its as strong as you push it or desire it to be. But just like imagination, without actions it produces no tangible lasting effect. Praying for one week, every night, will do less for your self identity and self esteem, than one day of charity help.

Sometimes you are treating the symptoms created by a belief system, with that very same belief symptom, and not with reality.

OP, maybe some time away from TV and the internet would help. At least here in America, we're always told to compete to be the best, but this isn't always the right mindset. No matter how successful any of us are, there will almost always be someone more successful. If there isn't, give it a few years. Rather than always seek this top position, I think it would help to step back from this competitive mindset and realize you won't find happiness there. You should be proud that you graduated college, have a boyfriend, are living on your own, and have a job, and you should be happy for their friends because *they're* happy pursuing what they want to do.

Adding: You don't have to read. This post has become a way to vent.

I think I am depressed. I never knew why I was the way I was. I don't know when it began, but I remember one of the first signs in high school. At first I though it was normal, someone told me it was normal. I had trouble sleeping, suicidal thoughts, I'd sit in my room with the lights off and cry, and in the middle of the night I would wake up feeling anxious. My father passed away when I was little so I thought I missed him or something. I really thought it was normal and I was going through a phase. I put it off to the side and just thought about college and my future, it's what kept me going at first. College came and I went to a community college for financial reasons. Everything was fine at first, I was doing great, I had a great GPA and my professors loved me. I still struggled with suicidal thoughts, anxiety in the middle of the night, and at times I cried. I though this was normal because I had gotten out of a bad relationship. I then transferred to a university and that's when it began getting worse. I don't know why it worsened, but it did. I lost motivation in school and I began failing. I eventually left because I just didn't have that strength in me to go anymore. I never knew I was depressed, I still don't know. I feel like I am making excuses for myself. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to feel the same way about my life or my future like I did in the past. And I want to so bad, but then the sense of numbness comes to me. I don't feel happy or sad or angry, I just feel numb. Then sadness comes and I cry at random words I hear, and I thinks its just everything I am repressing. My suicidal thoughts continue, but I don't go through with it, I just think it's normal. I really don't feel the need to call a hotline, because I don't go through with it. I want to see a doctor but I don't know where to begin. I don't have insurance. I am trying my best to find a job so I could at least see a doctor in a clinic. But when I do get a call back, I am scared about taking it. I really don't know where to start. I don't want to go to church because my mother is a minister, and I am afraid she won't understand. I feel like I am rambling, and I can't truly write anything I am thinking because everything in my head is coming at me so fast. I never talked to anyone how I feel. I just hid it. I always thought something was wrong with me, that I was being lazy and immature. I thought I could fix it myself and make it go away. But nothing is working. I really don't want to be depressed. I really don't want it to be that. I hoping that maybe, maybe I am just acting irresponsibly. But I just don't know what to do, I want to give up and stay in my bed and never wake up. I really want to finish school and have a career. And then I have an amazing boyfriend who has no clue what's going on, because I am too scared to talk to him. I sometimes don't contact him, because I don't want to talk. I make up excuses as to why I don't talk to him. I just sometimes don't want to talk to anyone. For the longest time I've been debating whether to post on here or not. But even as I write this, I don't feel better. I don't feel like some of the load has been lifted off. I still feel the same. I feel like nothing can make it better. I was hoping maybe if I told someone it would get better, I was hoping maybe it would go away. I have so much I want to say but when it comes to saying it, I feel there is nothing to say. I use to run. I was training for a marathon, then I lost interest. I want to do one so badly. But I just can't seem to motivate myself anymore. I have hid for so long, that I too scared to show my true thoughts. I try and act like I am happy, but it's getting difficult each day. You know re-reading this post, I just feel so selfish because I use I a lot. I hate that so much. It's the reason sometimes I don't want to express my self. I am just thinking about myself, when there are worse things happening to people. I am here just thinking about myself.

24687,,False,suburban_hyena,,,,"God, I hate what I'm going to say now - because I too would hate the advice.

Speak to a therapist. I know that step is very hard, when I told my mother I wanted to see a therapist I cried. When I told her why a few days later (because I'd been having thoughts about suicide) her reaction wasn't quite as supportive as I'd hoped, but she has come to see the problem.

You know, I know, that getting out from under the thumb of someone who is basically paying for your life (food, rent, education, etc) is hard. I'm 28 and I still live with my mother (in a cottage on the same property, but she's still right there) and am not wont for food, clothes, a bed, etc, but the first step to doing that is getting a job.

I've had a few over the years - I worked at a call centre for a few months before I had a MAJOR breakdown and went to a clinic for two weeks (paid for my dad's medical aid), I'm on medication which ran quite a high bill for a while (thank you for paying that too, dad) until I started going to a government clinic because of money. I worked as a receptionist in a game reserve (I live in South Africa), I did data research (scanning Google Earth for supermarkets, fun), I 'worked' in the film industry for a year (self-centered assholes).

I'm working at a bookstore at the moment. I started at 1.5 days a week at a salary that everyone around me thought was laughable - my parents, my friends, everyone was bitching about how I wasn't making enough - but I was enjoying it. The customers were (mostly) nice, although there are a few that make me want to strangle them, but I was buying my own lunches (fries) and drugs (weed, calm down) and I felt that I was going somewhere.

But we all know how depression works and despite having the job I enjoyed (minimal-esque work) and kept at it. Find a therapist you click with is a very hard thing, and I'm quite lucky that it's easy for me to gush out how I feel to anyone and everyone (wanna hear my life story, stranger? I'll tell you anyway), but it's something that, honestly, honestly, honestly, is very helpful. You need someone to talk to who is in no way connected to your 'real' life - not parents, not friends, not family, not girlfriends, sisters, sister's friends - A STRANGER who will listen and (yes) lead you to your own conclusions about your problem (And how do you feel about that is a stupid question, but if you answer truthfully, honestly and knowing your therapist will just nod when you say ""I want to murder him. I think about stabbing him so much. I want to...."" She will nod and say ""And how do you feel about that? Why stabbing specifically? How do you think your mother would feel?"" It sounds stupid, but she does want to help you (sure, she's getting paid to do it, but she got a degree to do this, and she does want to help).

Anyway, the other assistant at the bookstore left and I was bumped to three days a week. Half a year later I got a raise - obviously it still wasn't enough for the other people, but fuck that, I had a monetary support system. Right now, I'm working five days a week, crying about my life about 3 or 4 times a week (that's not actual amounts) and earning enough to save money for a trip to America, a tiny amount of rent (just a little because a. it makes me feel like I'm actually doing this for me, b. my mother isn't wallowing in money, she has just enough), food, still weed occasionally and random things. At the end of the month I still struggle, depression gets worse and I fell like a drain on my mother, my father, my friends, society even, but I manage to pull through.

This job is not glamorous, it doesn't pay well, and I'm getting to resent the people coming in, but I like it, and it's the only think that's kept me fairly sane these past two years (yeah, that's all it's been). I don't think anyone would be at a loss without me (they'd cry, but they don't *need* me) but I don't want to disappoint my boss who's helped me through so much, or my parents who despite having their own issues (my dad also dealt with depression, my mother... it's complicated) do love me. I don't think their lives would change, but she pushed me out of her vajayjay and he listens even when I ramble and use internet words he doesn't know, and I know how much it sucks to be sad (I've never lost anyone, but depression man) and sometimes I get really angry with my mother who doesn't understand depression (she has a bit of an ""well, just think of happy things"" attitude) but I don't want her to have to deal with that.

I don't know if that helped at all. I'm sorry, ended up rambling about my own life there.

tl;dr I think you should get a therapist, you might have to try a few, but it's VERY important that you (and probably your girlfriend) have someone disconnected from your life to talk to. Even if it doesn't seem like it's helping, just talking about will relieve some of the stress you're feeling (I mean, didn't writing this post help a bit?)",,0.0,,2015-04-07 09:23:53,,,0,False,,,,0,,cq3x9w6,,,,,t3_31q5m2,,,t1_cq3x9w6,,,,t3_31q5m2,,,,,,,,1432242803.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

I also find that when i get upset I want to lash out and be mean. I was trying to explain how I was feeling to my boyfriend and I told him it was like there are two mes. One is logical and upbeat and fun to be around and the other is emotional and cruel and introverted. 

I can't stop myself from slipping into the bad me and I'm afraid it's going to upset my life again. I feel like two different people completely. I can be in such a good mood and then once there's a trigger then I go off the deep end and I can't pull myself out.

I'm getting some stuff off my chest, but I also want to be as explicit as possible so that anyone who might have something relevant to share, no matter how small, can do it.  I realize I'm asking you a big favor in getting through this wall of text.  But I'd really appreciate it.  Only problem is that it's a super long typed up thing, so I apparently need to chop it into parts, so please refer to the comments for the rest of it.

The summary is this: I'm a 28 year old virgin, relatively successful, relatively in shape, who has plenty to look forward to and still has things he enjoys in life, but who is losing a battle against a crippling inferiority complex and the resulting depression.

My best theory for the origins of my issues are as follows:  I grew up in the rural midwest in a town of about 1,000 people.  My family was something of a local dynasty with a reputation, established over several generations, of being handsome local sports stars.  I realize now how meaningless it sounds to be a small town sports hero, but the world I grew up in felt a lot smaller.  In a town of 1,000 people, being a local sports star is about as close to celebrity as you can get.  The signs welcoming you to town proudly list all the years we managed to take state championship in each sport.  Ask anyone in town about their home team, and their chest would swell with pride as they recounted tales of battles won against schools ten times our size to bring the state championship home again.

One of my uncles was a 3 time state champion wrestler and set several records at the state level in football.  My father was similar athletically successful and had since become assistant coach of the hometown wrestling team.  These men, among others, started off a new generation of the Dynasty with a bang: though I had no brothers, I had plenty of cousins -- there were six other boys within four years of age of me who shared my family name.

Most of those boys grew to fulfill the family reputation nicely.  It started with blue ribbons in pee-wee wrestling and ended with year after year of state championships in football.  All across the state these strapping young lads had the heart of many a high school girl wrapped around their finger, a couple of them so remarkably handsome that it wasn't uncommon to catch out of town girls giggling over them as though they were the cover to Tiger Beat.  This newest generation of the Dynasty seemed to be the best one yet. 

And as you likely already guessed, I didn't exactly fit in with these other six.  It's not that we weren't close -- we were a tight knit family.  We grew up together, I was exceptionally close to most of them, and they are still among my best friends.  But as we grew older they took to sports pretty naturally and were celebrated by the entire town and family.  They were also nice guys overall, polite and well behaved.  They were even multi-talented and excelled in band and choir, taking home state awards regularly.

I, on the other hand, had interests elsewhere. I did sports to fit in, but never enjoyed it much (and sometimes flat out wanted to quit).  I also did music, and genuinely enjoyed that, but I never had the natural talent for it my cousins did.  I was much more interested in computers, technology, video games, public speaking, acting, storytelling, and fantasy novels.  At some of these things I excelled -- in grade school I was teased for my insatiable appetite for all things Nintendo, in high school I had a reputation as the go-to computer guy and my typing speed seemed to be a novelty to my peers.  But I was rather homely in appearance and sometimes outright embarrassing at sports, and it wasn't long before my ""black sheep"" reputation proceeded me.

I want to stress that while teenagers could be cruel about it, my family most certainly wasn't.  I never got on all that well with my father, but it wasn't because he was cruel to me.  It's just that we had no common ground -- he was born and raised a farmer in a small town, and he was content in everything that life had to offer.  He enjoyed the home town sports games and watching football on sunday.  He believed in hard work and the character of manual labor and being in the sun.  I honestly had very little interest in sports and wanted to instead by spending every moment I could in front of the computer.  He hated to see me in front of the computer.  And so I grew up being afraid of getting ""caught"" using the home computer (after we were able to afford one of our own, anyways).

That's all getting a little off course -- the point is that I grew up relatively happy, but unsurprisingly developed a kind of inferiority complex.  Though a few girls showed interest in me in my younger days, it never amounted to anything more than making out, and I always felt out of place in my own family through no fault of their own.  And so when I entered college in 1999, it was as an insecure, poorly dressed, and not particularly attractive computer science major.  I wish I could say I got out of my family's shadow, but that's not true either -- during my four years of higher education, five of those six cousins were playing college ball for my college or one nearby.

But I guess I don't want keep unloading on her with this sort of stuff. You know? I'd feel bad for that.

Unfortunately over the past three days, I've slowly fallen back into being depressed. I have a habit I'm trying to break that I kind of start over thinking some things and I guess that's done me in again. I guess how I've been feeling has kind of been influenced by mostly outside stuff or whatever.

I've been using Psych Central's mood tracker and my depression and anxiety have been up recently. My depression score has been up in the 50s twice, in the 30s once, and forties twice. 30 is the minimum score for being ""significant mood"". 

There are certain things I'm just plain unhappy over. I guess really focusing on them has made me realize how unhappy I am at the current state of certain things in my life. 

One I've been working on improving for a while (but it's a slow process and while I have come a long way, I still have a good ways to go). Oddly enough, this one is probably the most currently actionable item on the would-be list of things I'm unhappy about that I think needs fixing.

Unfortunately, the biggest thing that is making me unhappy I think if I could get that worked out, it would go a long way in making me feel better. Or at least help a good bit. It actually even would go into helping the other one or two things on my ""list"" as well, I think. 

Unfortunately, I've long said it wouldn't surprise if me I found out I had Social Anxiety Disorder or something. My SA has improved a good bit in many areas over the years, but unfortunately this particular area I'm talking about is sadly the one area that it has not improved at all and it makes an already difficult situation (for many people) that much harder to deal with for me.


I kind of know what brought this on, I guess. Unfortunately, thinking about it led me to thinking about the other things. Unfortunately I don't know if I can really talk about that thing though. I'd rather not publicly anyway.  Not that it matters, I guess. Nothing can be done about it at all right now.

You might notice a consequence of the way I think. Honestly, if I didn't have a support group that has forced it self upon me, I have no idea how I would have made it. The fact that I did have that external help might be hiding from me that I could have done it from within, but I honestly don't think so.

63862,,True,sastuff,,,,"The comments in the thread really seem to support your description of the demographic for this sub. I think I'm the only woman here...I don't think it's emotions. It's too difficult to quantify, and I have a problem with saying that one gender feels more than the other--that's the kind of stuff that made women into chattle. There is a long history of men being seen as superior and deeper. See: ancient Greece and bro-love being on the top of the heirarchy. I know guys in modern times get a rap for being emotionless and naturally just hard and stoic, but you don't have to prove that women feel less in order to dispute that claim.

Some thoughts: I think having trouble losing virginity is really depressing, and I suspect this is on the minds of a lot of guys 18-25. 

Society can be hard on dudes. I'm sure in certain places, it can be fucking depressing being a woman, too, like in societies where women are pried from their families at an early age and dowried-off to another that sees her as a liability. It would be weird not to be depressed. And on a societal level, women might have a harder time achieving happiness. I think it works both ways.

If you look at Japan, more hikkikomori are male. They have a huge, huge problem over there that looks like America's but on steroids. It seems like it can be really alienating being a young male. 

Expectations...Sometimes it's more extreme. Like you're a guy who comes from a culture with an incredible expectation to be professionally successful enough to support a whole family, including your parents for their whole lives...Or maybe you come from a culture where you're expected to fight wars. 

It's the same concept for our American society (or wherever people are from here, I forgot reddit was international). I don't know what it is exactly. I think maybe a lot of cultures here have expectations for guys that many can't achieve.

Going back to school I had a few people I hung out with but was usually the quiet outsider with nothing to say. 

I still live at home with my parents and having left college two years ago have only ever had one proper job for three months. During college I would literally hide in my room and on quite a few occasions stayed out all night effectively making myself homeless just to avoid my housemates.

I probably have social anxiety although I've never been diagnosed with anything. I get ridiculously terrified about doing things everyone else seems to find effortless. 

I have literally zero friends or social life. I just stay at home by myself most of the time. Not only have I never had a girlfriend or sex but I've never even been kissed or had any intimate contact whatsoever.

Lately I've started to think of suicide as the only rational way out and probably the inevitable conclusion to my shit little life.

Remember that she can commit suicide anywhere, not only in places far from friends &amp; family.

Talk to her about this situation and hear what she has to say about it. when you're depressed it is hard to adapt in a situation where it seems like nothing is working for you.

Just remember, as times passes it will get better. It won't seem like it now, in fact it may see worse for a while. You said it was a month ago so you're obviously still pretty hurt, I am guessing seeing her in your home every day doesn't help much. I would advise you to move out as she is asking, being around her isn't going to help you get over her any easier.

As for the home life thing, that is really tough and I don't blame you for not wanting to go home. I'd rather be homeless than ever live with either of my parents, so trust me, I know. Maybe you've got a friend you can stay with for a short while until you can find your own place. If you can't do that, see if maybe another family member can give you a roof for a short while. If both of those fail maybe you could find a roommate somehow (friend, acquaintance, find someone online) and get a new townhouse or apartment with them.

My father abandoned me on my birthday at age 11. Later turned out my mother planned on forcing him out that day in an effort to make me more upset, so she could use that with the lawyers. Well played, mother.

All of my friends (aside from 1) straight up switch to bullying me about my family situation.

Become incredibly depressed for most of my teenage years

Reestablish connection with my father only to have my mother kick me out of the house. Move in with my father only to have his new wife kick me out of their house. He then abruptly moved 1000+ miles away without warning, changed all his phone numbers and refuses to take any calls from me (I got his number from his brother).

My mother opens back up to me, but in a manner that seems to indicate she is only reestablishing a connection so if I ever become anything, she can mooch off me.

Somehow manage to drag myself out of the deep pit of depression I found myself in before.

**The last 3 years**

First girl I seriously ever tried to date seemed nice enough. Met at a party, traded phone numbers and facebook info. Called her the next day, set up a date. She didn't show up. She called and apologized and suggested an alternative date and time. She didn't show up again. She then changed her number and deleted her facebook.

Second girl I was interested in, resulted in me being in a 2.5 year long relationship. The first year was fairly emotionally abusive. She was always threatening suicide and self harm. However, I somehow managed to convince her to seek help. The relationship changed to long distance one.

Get accepted into graduate school but reconsider when I see the costs. My mother's new wealthy husband says I shouldn't worry about the costs, he will cover it all for me. Proceeds to allow me to enroll, gather lots of student loan debt and then tell me paying it off myself will be a learning experience.

**This year**

A friend I had had since childhood almost completely stops responding to texts and calls I send him in an effort to do friend things. When he does respond it is always the same excuse: family member's birthday.

My uncle (father's brother) ceased all contact with me after taking a trip to visit my father.

I got a really promising series of job offers from a friend who owns several businesses. Gets to the point where he is even telling me I should make arrangements to move. Then a week later he vanished and nobody has heard from him since.

Start applying to lots of jobs. Only two call backs after 300+ applications. Both found me too overqualified.

My friends begin to be less willing to do things with me. Opting instead to sit in their bedrooms reading or playing video games by themselves.

My mother's brother died in an accident and everyone else in the family finds out before me. In fact, I only learn through my aunt (my boss) calling my coworker to explain why she wasn't going to be coming in to work that day.

I come to realize my long distance relationship is no longer working out for either of us, and in fact is making us both miserable. After a lot of talking, and her crying, we switch to being good friends.

**This month**

Third girl I found on an online dating site. Ended up talking on the phone a little bit and planned a date. She didn't show up and then blocked my phone number and deleted her online profile.

My ex was date raped. Spent the following day crying to me on the phone as I had to push her to go to the police. Feel like it is somehow my fault. If I hadn't broken up with her, she wouldn't have gone on the date. I am her only friend, and her only emotional crutch, so she keeps calling me in order to vent and cry.

Fourth girl I found through her sister, an acquittance of mine. We set up a date and it went wonderfully. So wonderfully that she pushed for a second date before the first was even over. She wanted to come over to my apartment in order to cook dinner together. Shortly before the date, she sent an apology text saying she would be unable to show since she had a much more exhausting day at work than anticipated and desperately needed sleep. Tried calling the next day to sort out a new date and time only to get her voicemail. Sent her a text a week later to no avail.

------------------

Beginning to feel to weight of everything that has happened in the past several years crushing down on me at once. Despite attempts to fend it off, I can just feel myself sliding at an ever increasing rate back towards depression.

My family doesn't seem to care. My friends are pulling away. My ex dumps all of her emotional baggage on me. My job prospects seem bleak. Every girl I try to date subsequently flees with no obvious reason. 

I have returned to a point where I feel numb about everything.

I had friends I would talk to when things got bad, but they pretty much stopped talking to me for ANY reason and then one day one of them asked me if I acted depressed for attention. Well there goes that support. I had other friends that I talked to, but after that situation I didn't feel like I could talk to them as much because I was afraid I was bothering them or that they would think the same. I've reached the point where I have either pushed away or removed most of my support system because I am afraid of what they think or that they will all just assume I am being melodramatic. The last couple times I DID reach out the response was always just ""Well, have you talked to so and so about it?"". Being brushed off honestly feels even worse than thinking that I might be bothering someone, because its clear that to them I AM being a bother. Its not worth their time, and that hurts. At this point I feel like my options for help are down to professionals, but I dont trust them. I have been to therapists (not for depression) and they literally acted like I was just lying to them the whole time. And I went to another psychiatrist (psychologist? I always get them confused) this time for my depression, and their response was to put me on meds and not talk about anything or address any problems. We had weekly appointments in which I would sit down and they would say ""So how are you feeling? Good. We will keep your dosage up and see you next week"". The only thing they ever did to help was change the meds when I complained that they were making me very dehydrated (bit of a problem since I was in the army at the time). 

I am sorry... I know I am rambling a lot. I had a plan of what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say and its like it disappeared as soon as I started typing. Im just tired of everything. I am tired of pretending like everything is ok so that the people around me wont worry or feel uncomfortable. I am tired of answering ""Is everything ok?"" with ""yeah I am fine. just tired"" because tired is the truth even if I dont reveal my full meaning. I am tired of pushing through a seemingly endless life of problems, mistakes, and failures. I am tired of feeling like a burden on the few people who have a vague idea what is going on. I am tired of having to FIGHT myself just to acknowledge that I need help, and I am tired of wondering when I am actually going to give up and accept that nothing is going to get better. Again... sorry. I know this post probably makes no sense. I just needed to get it out and I dont feel like I can say it to the people around me. Thanks for listening.

My girlfriend has struggled with depression since around her freshman year of high school (she's 21 now).
Besides depression she has some of other things she struggles with, including social anxiety, panic attacks, which started after she got out of a 6 month marriage to a manipulative and verbally/physically abusive husband and suicidal thoughts.
I knew about her struggles before I started dating her and realized that it was not going to be an easy road and that every day would be a challenge and a struggle for her and us as couple but I fucking love her so all that was worth it. I made some mistakes early on such as thinking that I could make her feel better by showering her with compliments and telling her everything was going to be ok and basically thinking it was in my power to fix things and then feeling bad/guilty when I couldn't. 
After some research and communication between the two of us I found my role that best helped her when she was feeling the worst. Things are going well and we get to see each other at least once a month and we have a great relationship and I love her with all of my heart. 

However recently in the past few months I've become aware of a gradual change in my feelings towards her bouts of depression and anxiety over the course of our relationship. At the beginning the beginning it hurt my soul anytime she would call me in tears or text me how the depression was making her feel.
Over the past few months I noticed that I've become more and more apathetic towards the pain the depression causes her and it a culminated last week when we went out with some friends to celebrate my brother's birthday and she fell into a bout of depression right as we left for the party. I spent most of the party with her doing what I could to comfort her and didnt really get to enjoy the party at all. 
The entire time in my head all I could think was ""Really? This had to happen now?"" and was sort of in an angry funk by the time we went to bed.
After I realized how fucking selfish I was being and felt terrible about it for the rest of the week.
So my long winded question is, how do I keep from getting resentful? I love her so fucking much but being in a committed relationship with someone with depression is tough and I can feel it slowly wearing on me. I feel shitty for thinking about me when she's in so much pain.

You stopped updating your progress so I checked out your history to see how you're doing (I'm not stalking...just curious!).  Sorry to hear you're going through a rough patch, I hope you feel better soon.

Oh and if this helps: when I was going through depression in college...you know, hiding in bed not wanting to face the world or do my assignments or laundry, breaking out from anxiety, wearing a poker face for weeks, etc... I forced myself to cry.  Not just sobbing, but full out wailing and flailing my limbs around like a madwoman, screaming at the top of my lungs, ""I'M A FAILURE!  I'M GOING TO STARVE ON THE STREETS!  THE WORLD IS GOING TO END! akfNVDGSBNKDF!!!!""  The more dramatic the better.  

I think of it as a pre-emptive attack on the train of increasingly negative thoughts.  Those thoughts aren't going to be positive or rational anyway so I might as well give them a hand.  At the end of it I'd feel really silly and ridiculous, but it usually stops the spiral of negativity in its tracks.  Maybe the depressed part of me is too taken aback by the ludicrous display to keep warping my thoughts.  I also find it quite therapeutic and it usually puts me in a better mood for a while so I can pick myself up.

It's a really ridiculous exercise, but nothing about depression is rational (to me anyway), so maybe you can give it a try.  Ain't like you've got anything to lose by doing this, except maybe disturbing the neighbours.  I hope it'll bring you a little smile, or help you express any bottled-up sadness or anger.

EDIT:
Oh, you *asked* for advice.  Look out.

There's this idea of the ""Critical parent.""  It's the voice inside your head that criticize you.  Unfortunately, for many of us, the criticism are not all all constructive.  ""You always screw up.""  Sometimes that voice will go the extra step of just putting you down in general.  ""No one will ever love you.""

I find it useful to give that voice a different voice.  I mean, my thoughts are all typically in my ""internal voice"".  I can push on the critical parent and make its voice sound like my crazy grandmother.  Then it's a lot easier to ignore.

In a less psychotic way, you can just evaluate those thoughts by looking for key words.  ""Always,"" and ""ever"" and those sort of *absolute* words are signs that an idea/thought is irrational and unhealthy.  Reject those thoughts.

No, life is not all happiness and sunshine, and you are not in the least bit perfect.  But you don't ""always"" screw things up.  You will not ""ever"" be loved.

So again, it seems my problem is ego. I also have a daughter and am somehow biologically and emotionally inclined to desire her to have a good father. Obviously my inability to manifest this in annual trips to Disney or The Great Wolf Lodge proved too much for my ex-wife and thus her membership to dating sites and a string of disappointing applicants for the job.

The Buddha's example of witnessing the inequality in the world and 'just going out for a pack of enlightenment', doesn't fill me with a sense of peace. I understand Buddha spent a good amount of time confronting his regret, without, of course, just going back home. Could the Buddha have found enlightenment in the presence of his family? Apparently not. Maybe that is the answer for me: gtfo. But, I have digressed.

I really appreciate your post and will consider it. I'm not sure I can support a philosophy that immediately indemnifies behavior that hurts others, especially family. I guess I'm pre-Buddha old fashioned that way.

&gt;I have lately begun accepting ""getting though the day without damaging, destroying or somehow worsening the condition of anything in my environment"" as a valid goal for the worse days. As long as I take care not to be too lenient with myself there and still try my best every day I am confident this will work fine for helping me to just get through the day. Sure, I get nothing done, but just keeping all that undone work in my head and getting myself down instead of getting things done is hardly better. And perhaps, the next day I can have a fresh look at things.

Definitely a great way to think about it. When I'm at my worst I get into pretty destructive moods, so I totally see what you mean when you say that getting through the day without worsening your condition is a win.

I have also benefitted greatly from this conversation, I'm glad I commented! I've realized that opening up to people has really shown me the solidarity that exists between those touched by this disease. It's hard to understand depression unless you've experienced it first hand or have had to watch a loved one's constant struggle.  


I like the idea of just getting on a train for a short spontaneous trip. Reminds me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. :) Have you found other ways that help you relieve that stress? 


&gt;So the problems I have with self-esteem might likely (still) be pretty tame and moderate compared to what you may have experienced, please don't be mad if I compare them nevertheless :)

I really don't think I would have spent five years in hell if I was even marginally aware that depression was a real disease. Where I grew up, going to therapy was a foreign concept, and feelings were something to suppress and control. Maybe that's why I want to tell everyone my story now. Compare all you want if it helps you in any way. 

P.S. I want to mention that I am also lucky at my relatively short stint in mental hell. I am close to someone who has spent nearly four decades locked in a prison they created. I have watched the constant cycles, waxing and waning, ebb and flow.

* Male

* 21 years old

* Community college student

* CA, USA

----

So for the past few years I've been feeling like my life isn't really progressing. My life feels like a boring state of stagnation. I don't know if it's worthy of a diagnosis of ""depression"" or not, I've never asked a doctor,  but I need to vent a little...

I have no job. I've only worked one job two days total in my life. Every other time I've applied for work I've never received a response. The lack of feedback really diminishes my incentive to apply more. I feel really helpless having no money. I'm very fortunate to be under my mother's roof, but sometimes this makes me feel even more helpless. I really want to move out but I don't see that happening soon. Any cash I do get is usually $5-10 gifted to me by my mother or grandmother every once in a while.  I feel so disconnected from friends because I rarely leave the house except when I go to school or the library. Sometimes I've been covered by friends if we go eat or something, but that feels lame. I can't really explore many hobbies because that costs money. I'm severely limited in what I can do outside of the house; everything I do must be free or I have to pass on it.  I sometimes go chill at the beach because it's free and the combo of the waves and ocean air is refreshing and relaxing, but that's an hour and a half bus/light rail trip each way minimum so it's far from time efficient to go often and that's usually something I do solo. I have no car so when I go anywhere and when is determined by the local public transportation . The lack of a car also severely limits where I can work as it needs to be a reasonable commute by public transportation from school or home. Anyone in SoCal knows how much it sucks not having a car. 

My education has also suffered greatly. I wasted almost two years at cc withdrawing and failing classes. I didn't even have a solid grasp of what major I wanted until last year. I'm doing better but not by much really. This semester I've been dropped from two classes because of lack of attendance. I feel so behind my peers I grew up with. Many will be graduating already in the spring and I'm barely starting my basic pre-major classes. School isn't really a place I'm pumped to go to in the morning. I have to take a 40 minute bus ride to school and the bus I take is once every hour, so if I miss it I miss my first class entirely. Some days I don't even want to leave my bed as it's far more comfortable than having to deal with getting ready and going to school. I need to take my education more seriously and I'm really disappointed in myself for  neglecting it. 

As referenced above, my social life is pretty much dead. As is the nature of community colleges and having to commute, I also haven't made any new friends in a while.  I only really have maybe 5 people who I communicate with regularly. My best friend is basically my cat. Most people I knew or was friends with in high school have faded into acquaintance territory. I haven't even been in a relationship with a woman since my freshman year of high school. Obvious consequence is obvious. All of this together really makes me feel like I have very little shared context with the people around me, thus making it harder for me to make new friends than it already is; I feel like a hermit. I want this to change, but I have no clue where to start. 

Everything in conjunction has made me feel like my life is going nowhere. I can't find my incentive to move forward. I have an idea of what I want to do in the future, but I'm not seeing any improvement on the micro scale. I can see the island off in the distance but it seems that the water in between never gets shorter.

I want to be better than this, but I don't even know what ""this"" is. It'd be great if others could comment with any advice on anything I've written or opinions on how to move forward. Should I see a doctor or therapist? Are there some easier ways to make impactful short-term improvements in one's life?

12761,,True,jeffhead81,,,,"Beginning in 2007, my life began to unravel.  I discovered my wife cheating on me, I got sued by a client on a frivolous matter (I know, I know, it's frivolous only when it's against you but not when it's against others), I was diagnosed with skin cancer, all of my previously solid property acquisitions were tanking, and foreclosure was distinct possibility, to name a few stressors.  I was at the end of my rope emotionally and psychologically.  Sleeping more than 3-4 hours a night was a luxury.  Nothing made me happy anymore, and I couldn't focus on myself, my kids or my business.  
A colleague suggested seeing a psychiatrist and considering meds.  Up to that point, I had always relied on my own wits and pride to get me through tough times.  This time, the dam was about to break.  I simply wished to curl up in bed and never get up to deal with stuff.  
Finally, I relented and made an appointment with a well-regarded psychiatrist who helped many professionals in my area.  It was the best decision I made.  I was diagnosed with situational depression and anxiety and was prescribed Lexapro (10mg/day). I felt the effects within a week.  I could finally get some sleep; I stopped waking up at 4:00 a.m. everyday to ruminate about all the bad things happening to me (aka ""the witching hour""); that pit in my stomach was gone, and I was able to start functioning normally again.  The biggest change I noticed was that the small stuff no longer bothered me like it did during high-stress periods in my life.  Things simply started rolling off my back. It was an amazing transformation back to ""normal.""  
I have been on Lexapro for two years now.  Eventually, once I have weathered the storm, I will wean myself off the drug and will continue exercising to keep my mind and body in good shape.  
Lexapro was a life-saver for me.  I would recommend getting on meds if all else has failed.  Don't let your pride get in the way of healing.  You can wean yourself off just about any drug with the help of your doctor.  
Regarding forgetting to fill your prescriptions, my pharmacy (Walgreen's) automatically refills my prescription every thirty days and calls me to remind me to pick it up. Perhaps yours will do the same. 
BTW, the lawsuit against me was eventually dismissed, the opposing attorneys were sanctioned, and I was awarded my attorney's fees.  SWEET JUSTICE! ",,0.0,,2011-01-02 22:27:24,,,0,False,,,,0,,c1b6w77,,,,,t3_euy4z,,,t1_c1b6w77,,,,t3_euy4z,,,,,,,,1426667618.0,,2,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,2,,

Recovering your life while you're depressed is like playing Jenga on a platform that's constantly vibrating.  You keep on trying to build, and it keeps falling down.  It's not your fault that it's falling down.  Most people don't have to deal with shaky foundations.  You'll curse yourself and feel horrible because everyone else is building these grand towers and you can't get past 5 levels.

So the medication stops the platform from shaking.  Does that mean that you'll always have to take it?  No, certainly not!  You might build stronger towers that can withstand all the shaking.  You might start supergluing your tower together.  The point is, you'll need to work harder to build something that lasts while you have the respite from the shaking.

I'm a sophomore in college and I pissed away my entire freshman year because i was depressed and didn't do shit about it. This year when I fuck up I go to my professors and explain my situation and everything works out because they see that I am trying.

If you talk to your professors and show them that you are working to fix the problem, they will give you the opportunity to fix it.

*Again, it's not too late but it will be if you keep waiting. It can be intimidating at first but take that first step now. If you can't bring yourself to do it today, take the day off and rest and organize your thoughts and get mentally prepared to take on the rest of the semester and do it tomorrow. Don't put it off any longer.

But, that site is home to some of the most radical, ignorant, batshit-insane people I've ever seen.

Have you ever heard of the word ""albeist""? What about ""cultural appropriation""? They even invented a term for people who are cisgender and heterosexual, calling them ""cishets"". Ever seen the terms ""male privilege"", or ""male tears""? According to Tumblr, males can't have depression or self-harm. Males are also all sexist, shallow pigs that want nothing but to ruin women's lives. Their problems are virtually nonexistent when compared to women's, and they have to feel bad that they hold so much privilege. All men must be taught not to rape, because they all want that no matter what they say otherwise. Also, sexism against men doesn't exist.

Oh, and if you're white, you're even worse. White people's problems are meaningless. They don't exist because all their lives are privileged. Also, racism against white people doesn't exist.

What an awful site. The subreddit /r/tumblrinaction exists solely out of the lunatics it hosts. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, I would highly advise avoiding those kind of people. They're referred to commonly as ""SJWs"" or ""Social Justice Warriors"".

Does anybody else get depressed because of Tumblr? There were an entire two months a while back in which I first discovered this. I spent each day of my life in deep and dreadful loathing. I became suicidal because I irrationally feared everybody was like that. I thought everybody hated me. I hated me, too.

I'm dating someone. She knows how I am. She's actually wonderful, and much better than the cheating bitch who brought me into depression. It will probably end in a year when she moves. I'm not sad about it. I don't plan on dating after her.

I have a job. It's a good environment. Definitely much better than what brought me into depression. I just don't care about it. I'd switch careers, but nothing makes me excited.

I had hobbies before. Now I don't do anything when I get home. I just watch Netflix or Twitch.

Everything that I was depressed about once before has been ""solved"". My life looks alive once again, but I'm still apathetic about it all. I don't have purpose. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing makes me sad. 

I've been through therapy a few years back. I was diagnosed with major depression, but right now, I don't even know if this is depression anymore. I'm not sad. I'm not suicidal. I just don't care about anything. If I did, I'd kill all my desires.

I think about 10 years ago from now, I was 6 years old and my dad had just showed me my first anime, Akira. It was fucking awesome and I was amazed by the art and the story and the everything and it had left a lasting impression which would last for years. Over the years I had got into all sorts of anime shit like Pokemon, Naruto, FMA, Inuyasha, Watamote and later in life some weird fandom called Hetalia.
Yeah I was pretty much a weeb, but I was okay about it. I kept myself lodged deep in the anime world like the other fans, it was something to be a fan of and to keep myself interested in something. Eventually somewhere this all stopped when my desire to be considered normal like the rest of the jocks in my school had become larger. I stopped reading all my favorite mangas, stopped playing Pokemon games, stopped watching Naruto and honestly I just got this feeling like it wasn't cool. 
I feel so insecure about myself, angry because of all my other problems in life with school and family and depression and I don't have the energy to get myself into all of this anime craze, and I have tried and it only ended up making me cry at the end of each episode because of the memories.

Let me preface this by saying I have rather minimal knowledge on depression, all I know is from reading about some symptoms/signs of depression on the internet.

I believe that someone close to me that I care very much about is suffering from depression, and I want to do everything that I can to help her. What I mean by I believe she is suffering from depression is that I've noticed that she shows some symptoms of depression, but she has never said that she is depressed or that she struggles with depression, so she either doesn't want to say it or she hasn't quite realized it herself, OR I'm completely wrong. But for example, every now and then, I'd say maybe once a month, she gets in a really bad mood and I'll always ask her what I can do to help her, and she says that there's nothing that anyone can do, and that she doesn't understand why she feels this way. This was a bit frustrating to me because I want nothing more than for her to be happy and I couldn't do anything to help. Another sign of depression that she's shown a bit more frequently is anxiety. Just recently she told me that she wasn't feeling well and that she was feeling anxious for no reason. 

I did a bit of reading on symptoms/signs of depression just to see which, if any, symptoms applied to her. As it turns out, both of the signs I mentioned earlier are symptoms of depression. 

Since I care so much about her, I decided to look around on Reddit to see what I could learn to be able to better understand depression so I could then help her overcome this. I decided that my best bet is to ask for advice from people that have dealt with this kind of issue before, whether they personally battle depression or they've just helped someone overcome it. I realize that this could be a draining experience for me as well, but I'm very willing to be the emotional support that she needs to overcome this, she's very worth it to me.

I want to help her overcome this, but I don't want to approach her about it because I don't want her to think I'm trying to diagnose her or that I'm implying that she seems sick, so that's another thing that I'd like some advice on.

To finish off, I'd like to thank anyone and everyone that does offer advice, I am very grateful for that.

Truthfully, having healthy friendships would make me happy. Being in love, getting rid of my anxiety and gaining confidence and social skills are all things that would make me happy.

Do you need the money in order to live, or do you have savings? If you can, consider the benefits of taking time off without a job to get healthy rest and focus on yourself. 

If you do need the money, talk honestly with your boss. This may not be possible if you are in a job that could easily replace you, but if you are in a career job and (hell, who knows, maybe even if you're not), your boss may be willing to work with you to give you some leave to settle in to the anti-depressants, rest, and meet with your therapist.

A break will lessen the daily stress on you and potentially give you time to talk to others about how you're feeling. Hopefully, those others will give you honest appraisals and work with you on what you truly want. 

I'd recommend taking up a solo exercise that you enjoy (running, yoga, swimming). The endorphins will help and it may help you get the satisfaction every day that you did something to improve yourself.

It doesn't even sound like a bad dream.  It isn't a bad dream, it's who is in them and where they happen.

I just had one.  I was working in some retail store (I think I'd rather die than work retail) and all these people from my life that I have gotten out of my life were there.  I have dreams that are no different than somebody's normal day to day life, nothing really out of normal happens -- sometimes my dream is quite literally, a dream of a normal day at my job, when I worked, as I have been retired for several years.

As a side note, I had the best job, it paid well, I loved it, and I was damn good at it.  I had a stroke and heart attack among many other health issues and won't work again.  One of my OTHER recurring dream issues is me working part time because of my disability, and trying to work some but not too much or the insurance company will find out.  The terms are: I cannot work or go to school -- I cannot even register for college for the student discount on software (which would help out a lot, since I sit at home all day).  As for work, I can't work part time, because I don't have a brain anymore.  It really really comes out if you try to have a conversation with me.  I look at all the software I've written, and it's like a foreign language.  I've tried to relearn, but I haven't realearned that much of anything.

So back to dream.  I'm working, part time, not enough hours to make a living but ""too many hours"" to be on disablity (in my brain) in some retail store.  This time it was selling suits.  

I think I should probably not read r/TalesFromRetail ever again.  Humor here, but only a little humor -- I think that subreddit gives me nightmares.

So to make a short story long, I just woke up, I didn't know who I was, where I was, and I was late to work, 20 years younger, in another city, these people were still in the 'friends' category (they were never my friends, they are nobody's friends -- I just hadn't learned that hard lesson yet).

I wake up from a very realistic dream that I didn't know was a dream, because the monsters weren't so obvious, and I was younger, newer, smarter, able bodied, and different.  

Those are the most upsetting dreams for me.  Sometimes I have to get up, check the computer, check email, voice mail, send myself an email, make sure what day it is and what my address and age is.  I have to make double sure and triple sure, because I ""wake up"" and do that sometimes and I still am in a dream.  I think, oh, what a terrible dream, thank god it was just a dream.  I'm going to get up I hear my grandmother, she's up so it's probably close to breakfast time.  Then it takes a while for the fog to clear and realize that she's been gone so long, and that I haven't lived with her in almost 3 decades.  No more breakfasts, no more of the one person in my life who always could make life seem right.

Just learn as much as you can from your mistakes while you're young.

I just recently moved to NYC, with not too much money. I'm ok to get by for now. When I moved I lost my job, which also provided me with benefits. I'm now working a contract role, so I don't get benefits. I figured it would be no big deal, because I'm under 26 so I can still get on my parents plan until I found a full-time gig.

My father called me today and told me that my stepmom (who they are insured by) just lost her job. Now not only am I out of insurance, so is my family.

I come from a pretty well off family from both sides, in terms of education and money. My dad is kinda the black sheep in the family and because of this sometimes I feel like I am as well. Hes struggled his whole life to kind of figure out what he wants to do. He is college educated and a professional, just never did well compared to the rest of the family and only recently started working again.

I feel like because of this, I have to prove myself to the rest of my family. Don't get me wrong, I love my father and hes done so much for me, but its hard seeing everyone in my family succeed and my father fail time and time again. Especially because he really is such a good person. It breaks my heart.

I wish there was more I could do, but I feel stuck. I don't have friends I can talk to that would understand. If I tell anyone in my family, I feel like they will just be judging my father. I don't have a SO to talk to either.

I have 2 half sisters from my dad's side that are significantly younger than me, so I can't depend on him for money or much else because he has them to worry about and I'm an adult.

I feel so alone sometimes. My family sees me and always comments how proud of me they are and how I've done so much. Making snide remarks like ""[my name] raised her dad, not the other way around"" because I'm so mature, blah blah. This really hurts to hear. Especially, when I know its not true.

My name isn't important, because I'm afraid that someone might recognize me. I'm in high school, and I live in a small town, somewhere. 

I'll get straight to the point, I'm depressed. I'm currently out of Lexapro, and I have to go through a psych evaluation to get more. 

I'm going to try to identify my problems, so you guys can get a good idea of what advice to give.

Abandonment issues
Low confidence, and low self-esteem
Social anxiety/awkwardness
Overthinking
And well, depression

They've always been a part of me, ever since I was a kid. My father left when I was little, and I had problems with that for the longest time. I've always tried so hard to fit in with people, but to no avail. I guess I've just kind of.. Glided along with these things, until recently. About 8 months ago, I met this girl. 
Let's call her J. 
J and I were good friends. She introduced me to her group of friends, and that's how I met my ex-girlfriend, T. 
They made me feel like I was finally a part of something, that I belonged. T made me feel appreciated, and loved.
We broke up after 4 months, but it wasn't a surprise. I knew things weren't okay when she started talking to her ex, and inviting him over. I thought that I should take the initiative, and break up with her. She had no objections, and I was absolutely destroyed. My depression had a real reason to, like, come out and eat me away. It wasn't just about the breakup, it was about all my insecurities, my doubts, my fears, and my problems. I was empty. I stopped eating, and threw up when I did. I dropped weight, and I rarely spoke. I cried, every day.
All of my drive to keep going was quickly diminished, and I tried to commit suicide. I put the gun in my mouth, but it didn't go off. I hated myself even more, after that.
I'm not friends with any of J's friends, anymore. They never liked me in the first place.

I moved schools, because of my horrible grades and the people I hung out with. I did much better, at this new school. It was a fresh start, somewhere that I could be whoever I wanted to be. I met this wonderful girl, C, who is seriously the kindest, most interesting and amazingly beautiful girl I've ever met. I asked her out, and she said yes. I found out that she wasn't ready to be involved with anybody, so we talked about it, and didn't go. I wasn't mad, and I was glad that I knew, so we could stay friends. 

But that was quickly clouded.

I started following her to her classes, barely making an attempt at real conversation. I messaged her, constantly, and always wanted to stop. I was trying to tell her so many things at once, and I always choked up. I was trying to tell her that I was sorry, that I didn't want to bother her. That I don't mean to be the way I am, that I want to change. I hated bothering her.
I didn't want to drive her away, okay? I never wanted to ruin things with her.

""Like a lost puppy"" is how she put it. She said that she wasn't worried about those things, and that I needed to calm down. That it was okay.

But it's not okay. I'm so fucking embarrassed with how I acted. I'm so incredibly disgusted with how I am. I just want to start over with her, and with everyone.
I want to start over with myself. 
I want to change, but I don't know how to.

They can see your pain even though you try to hide it, and though they probably don't know how, they want to help.  Because they care.

37321,,True,brainfullof-fuck,,,,"I honestly have no clue. Social situations drive me insane. It's like I can't breathe. Everyone's happy and chatting at the bar, and I just can't find the words? It leads to panic. I wonder now if that's a result of what I've become. I wasn't always that way. In fact, I was almost the opposite. I wonder a lot about what it would take to become a better version of who I used to be before everything happened. In response to your ideas:

1: Yes, I know all about trust but verify. My dad used that term with me a lot when I left for college. Except it was more about grades than anything. Trust but verify seems so counterproductive. ""Oh, you want me to trust you? Just let me know what you're doing all the time."" It sounds extremely controlling and only used in situations like...well the cold war. Where both have to show proof the other is doing better, or else all hell breaks loose. I suppose if something were truly in the shitter, this might be a way to get started and back on track. However, something like this usually leads to what I called in my post ""pre-emptive asshole-ery"" where I do asshole things because I don't trust them and expect them to do the same. When I'm right, I'm angry I'm right. I'm also entirely vindicated. I guess that's something I'll have to watch out for if I really want things to get better with someone.

2: Well *now* my mother understands the situation. At the time all she could say was, ""Don't quit. Be strong."" I know she didn't realize my life had completely fallen apart around me. I had lost a job I actually loved, my grades were completely in the shitter, I couldn't get more than two hours of sleep, I was being hazed to hell and back, self confidence in the shitter, and to top it all off when it was over, I just got smacked upside the head at the end of the semester by my parents and they told me to do better. I had completely lost any idea of who I was; a shadow of who I was. It was at that moment I realized I could never count on them for anything relatively important.

Now, she knows. It wasn't until two years later until I told her how fucking terrible it was. Very drunkenly and dramatically. Man, that night was hell. My mother is a saint, bless her heart. I really don't think she realized. Things have changed for me a lot since then, but her reaction to being told all of it tells me she finally understands. She's the mother-iest mother that ever mothered. Yet I still don't trust her. It's like a bridge being burnt. Once the bridge has been burnt, all that remains is a charred black mess. And I have no clue how to build a thing.

I have to ask, being as...age advanced compared to me, how in the hell are you not completely cynical? After everything, my twisted philosophy has become, ""do unto others before they can do unto you."" A woman is what caused this post. I never find myself able to find the right words to talk to a new one.

As far as what I'll do? I have no idea. If things are to be made right then I have no clue where to even begin. Like I said, trust but verify sounds like it could work for a time, but that's exhausting to both parties. It would be as if my nose is where it shouldn't be. Trusting people to the degree they deserve is a hard proposal. That would mean operating under the assumption that you understand a person's motives. If trust is to be a game, then I can't lose. If I lose, I have to win at losing.

I'm a 15 year old girl and I'm not sure whether or not my situation I'm about to explain is some kind of depression. 
Whenever I think back on my life, there hasn't been a lot of moments where I'm ever happy, all was good for me, a loving mother and father and a stable home with new friends and a new school. Those are the only times I can remember not feeling numb or trying not to let it all out for everyone else's sake. 
During the middle of primary school, my parents were always fighting each other, calling one another all these terrible names I didn't quite understand. Eventually this led to a divorce and me along with my other siblings going to see my dad at his new house with the girl he was cheating on my mum with and their son. With me being the eldest child I didn't cry about it, not once because I never wanted them to see me cry, I had to be strong for them and mum, I especially had to make her think I was fine so she didn't get upset about hurting me about her decision to divorce him. I used to watch my siblings most nights so mum could work night shifts to make extra money to keep us alive, during that time she was very depressed and brought guys home with her making temporary new dads for us. 
We were always switching from house to house, school to school, I still never cried about anything. Everything I do, every emotion I show is carefully thought out before I do it so they don't catch on that I'm actually a fucking mess. It was okay for a while. I found a new male I could call dad, he has 3 kids with my mum but is now in jail for things I don't want to even speak about.
Sorry I've gone a bit off track here but today I've come to a realisation, I was talking to my dad on the phone today, as we don't see each other since he moved. Within 5 minutes of taking to him on the phone he had reduced me to tears and I was trying to hide it like I always do. I realised I need help. This isn't how 'normal' people live. So reddit what I'm really trying to say is, I haven't felt real emotion within myself because I'm always worried about keeping the other people happy, I feel numb to everything and when I do cry I do it so nobody sees, I've thought about suicide for as long as I can remember but that won't be fair on mum or my brothers and sisters, they're my main priority, so instead I self harm in places they wouldn't think to look, and I don't eat for days at a time. I'm always afraid about what people think of me so I PLAN OUT conversations with them in my head so they don't judge me. I make up things to feel accepted. The main problem is that I know I need to confront my dad about how I feel, or even get a counsellor but I'm afraid if I start crying in front of him or someone I won't be able to stop.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,I'm lost here.,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1yp63w/im_lost_here/,

I don't know how to tell this story other than with word vomit. sorry.

My older brother has been unemployed for 6 months now and is living at home with our parents. I got married just last year and am still getting on my feet.

He graduated from a college program in spring '14 and has been job hunting since then. He's asked for money but I hesitated because he spends what little money he has on weed and video games. I've told him how I feel, but he said he just feels like I'm looking down at him. He said I am the only one around him who hasn't been supporting him. He's been holding onto a grudge against me because we've always tended to have tiffs but he never lets me live them down. I'm getting exhausted. 

I want to fix our relationship, but he has been spiraling into depression. I don't know what to do. He talks about money all the time, and then when I tried to give him some, he said he didn't want to take ""my"" money. I've apologized for my past actions. I don't hold any resentment toward him, I try to talk to him and ask him about his job search etc, but he barely gives me the time of day. 

I am just tired, but I don't want him to go and do anything stupid. I'm also trying to support a family, so I can't really support him financially. not to mention, he lives at home. Our parents pay for his food and rent and bills. (basically) Maybe I am being self centered, but I don't know how to change my thinking...

Should I pity him? I am soooooooo frustrated that there is nothing I can do. We try to talk about our problems, but they only seem to get worse.

He's just told me that he hates me and he is ""this close"" to suicide. 

Please help!

About a year ago, my parents moved my family from Texas to Arizona. To give a little backstory: We move a lot. I have lived in 5 states and gone to 7 schools since kindergarten. We lived in Dallas, TX twice and it was my favorite place we had lived. We moved from Chicago to Dallas right before I was in 8th grade. At the school that I went to, most of the kids had just gotten there, so making friends wasn't all that difficult. Cut to the middle of junior year, Everyone knows and loves me, I was unanimously elected to homecoming court, and I had a group of friends that were closer than any friends I had ever had. My friends and I hung out with tons of people all the time and it was amazing. My teachers loved me and so did the faculty. My dad informed me that he had gotten a new job that was located in Scottsdale, AZ. I was disappointed but I thought ""No big deal. I've done this many times before."" I have never been so wrong in my life. It is exactly a year later and I have never been so sad. I rarely ever talk to anyone at school. I keep my head down and try to get through the day. There were a few people in the beginning who tried to be my friend but have since given up because of my constant quietness and seriousness that they mistake for hatred or loathing. Keep in mind that I am a 230, 6'3, black guy who's ""neutral"" expression is a soft frown. My closest friends know that my expression is involuntary and mostly means I'm in deep thought but these people don't get it.

Basically, I don't know what to do. My parenrs believe I'm being dramatic and have convinced themselves I'm just ""going through a phase"". This sadness feels like a rock on my heart and I can't keep dealing with it. I struggle to use the word ""depression"" because I haven't been diagnosed and I don't know for sure how much worse some others may have it. Anyway, I could really use some help. Either way, getting this off my chest so that at least someone would hear me helps. Thanks.

I always have been the kind of person who needs plenty of space, but I have hardly left the house in the past month, and have seen nobody socially in that time.

I've been struggling with what, at best guess, seems to be depression for the better part of the last three or so years. I'm wishy-washy on the diagnosis because I've yet to talk with any medical professionals about it, however, I do recognize the signs and that there is a problem. I do want help, but I don't feel like I deserve it, and I feel foolish talking about it.

Part (read: most) of the problem concerning my lack of outreach for help is the question of ""why me?""The rationale is that everybody in this world has their own problems; their own shit to deal with. So, as I wallow in my own sorrow, I can never find the... Something... To reach out and ask for help. I don't want to make my problems and my concerns somebody else's responsibility. I find it far easier to pretend nothing is wrong than to open up to anybody.

Furthermore, the ""Why me?"" mentality goes beyond simply asking for help; it's a recurring theme. I have a hard time maintaining friendships or any relationship for that matter, because I can't understand why somebody would want to spend time either talking to or spending time with me when there are countless other people without the glaring personality faults that I have. As a result, I'll share a few conversations with any new ""friend,"" and perhaps even venture out into the world for a brewski or three. But it's never long before I begin to overanalyze previous conversations, and subsequently convince myself that I've made some terrible faux pas, or otherwise said or done something objectionable. At that point, I would rather extricate myself from the conversation or situation, so as not to become a burden (or be seen as a category - 5 clinger) to whomever has the misfortune of being in my company at the time.

I also don't remember the last time I felt at home or wanted anywhere. If I ever go to a friend's house, I'll typically cut the whole thing shorter than it needs to be so as not to overstay my welcome. I've moved back in with my Dad for the summer, and even though he is rarely home, I feel like I'm overstaying my welcome here too. It's nothing my Dad does, either. He's always had my best interests at heart, and I know he would help if I asked. That's why I find it so disconcerting that when he asked me point blank last week ""Are you depressed?"" I laughed it off and told him everything was hunky-dory. I wanted so badly to open up and tell him, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

All I really want to do is figure out a way to get away from everybody. That way, nobody besides me needs to be burdened with the problems I have.

I already know that some of these thoughts/feelings are irrational at best, but somehow, that doesn't seem to help me push the thoughts aside.

10 years ago (last year of high school) I suffered major depression (Psychiatrists diagnosis, not mine). It was the toughest 2 years of my life. All due to the fact that I had a very small circle of friends and was bullied every day from Grade 7-12.  But, I got through it. I got through it. 

I have had a lot of other medical issues since then which have made it very difficult to either obtain or maintain a job. I have been to classes to obtain certificates to better myself and the work available to me. I am going back next year to obtain another 3 certificates over the next three years so that I can work in Pathology. I have a goal.

So, why does it seem like everything is just caving in around me again?

Most of my friends have moved away and started lives of their own (as they tend to do.) Which, I understand but, it still hurts to think about.

I don't call my friends any more as I seem to get (unhealthily) hurt if they are too busy to talk or hang out. I fear that rejection so much that I just don't bother any more.

I can't seem to handle criticism the way I used to. Even if it is in jest, I get overly hurt and just want to hide away from everything. Or I want to tell the criticiser that they are a dick and cut them out of my life. I seem to be ok if it is constructive criticism though...

I buy so many material possessions that I end up with no money at all. I have a room full of useless crap that, at one time, I was so proud to own. I can't seem to save money at all. Mind you, I still pay my bills on time and I never go hungry. 

I am a smoker. 1 month ago, I was down to around 5 a day from 20. Now, I'll be lucky if a 50 pack lasts a day. 

Basically, I feel like I'm spiralling out of control again and have been for quite some time. I recently fucked up a perfectly good relationship because of my unresolved personal emotional instability and I feel like that event was the last nail in the coffin. 

Anyway, I have an appointment with a psychologist soon so, hopefully they can help me out with this. I'm just glad I realised that what I am feeling and my behaviour is not normal. And I'm glad I made the decision to go and seek help.

I have the same fears of being in a relationship: That I will burden someone with my emotional turmoil, and push them away. This has gotten to the point that I have convinced myself that I am not capable of being with someone, even though deep down, it is all I want.

Dating for the first time in my life at an older age (32) has reinforced my insecurites, but also motivated me to accept myself, given me self confidence, and helped my social anxiety.


It is tough to face rejection time after time, and it makes me question if I am ready. I dont believe that I am, I need to be able to stand on my own two feet. Maybe then I will stop pushing people away, or overwhelming them with my emotions.

My depression is linked to memories.  I know it sounds cliche, but the memories are from my childhood.  I can be at work, or reading a book, or just doing some mundane thing around the house...nothing needs to trigger it.  It happens suddenly...the memories just seem to take over and I can't stop it.  I usually see myself from the outside, and a kind of montage starts running through my mind: I see that little girl, shy, put down by problems at home, insecure as a member of the lower middle class at a school dominated by the wealthy, wearing oversized hand-me-downs, playing alone in the playground, staying quiet all day, no friends, isolated, scared...and then I'm older, in middle school, still in hand-me-downs, still alone, awkward and underdeveloped while the girls around me start growing...and then the torture begins.  Everyday the same guys attack me...not physically, just psychologically.  It's not the flirtatious kind of mean...the things they say to me are so cruel they don't bear repeating.  And there's no relief.  All day, every single day, they torment me; I beg them to leave me alone.  I tell them they don't have to be nice to me, they don't have to like me, I just beg them to ignore me.  But they refuse.  They just smile and keep on going.  I start to change.  I get moody, scared, impossibly insecure.  By the time I'm in high school my anorexia has set in.  I become mean.  I lash out, I cause trouble, I make my peers and my teachers hate me.  I know what people say about me behind my back.  They don't try to be discreet.  And I know that they're right.  I hate myself.  By senior year I'm mostly over my anorexia but the damage is done.  I've permanently stunted my growth due to starving myself during crucial developmental years, lost hair, and caused all sorts of stomach problems that will most likely never be resolved.  

It's 10 years later.  I think I'm a nicer person now.  More stable.  But that scared little girl is alive and kicking.  I still find it hard to talk to new people, and often stutter or find it hard to look at them.  I'm still insecure, but I am pretty sure that is something that will never change.  I've had periods of time where I made friends, but they were always transitory.  I would say I'm still mostly alone.  These montages that run through my head come unbidden.  And I'm always left with this aching desire to go back in time, to scoop up that little girl, to kiss her and hug her and tell her that she's loved, and that everything will be ok, and that she shouldn't be scared.  But I can't.  And I never will.  And I just wish I could remember that little girl happy, just once.  But I can't.

Any pharmaceuticals should be a last resort, you don't want to become dependent on anything at such a young age.

58208,,True,[deleted],,,,"Heads up, addiction takes longer to form than a few weeks. Although nicotine itself isn't all that addictive. E-cigs don't contain the same chemicals as tobacco smoke. A couple of the chemicals in tobacco smoke are thought to be largely responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco. What happens is that nicotine causes a release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters. Those particular chemicals I mentioned block the destruction and reuptake of the neurotransmitters that were released due to the nicotine. So, it's possible that just consuming nicotine isn't as addictive as actually smoking. 

Aside from the possibility of becoming addicted, I'd try not to rely on nicotine to feel better. It's not a drug that treats depression or anxiety. It more or less just gets you high, so to speak. 

I dip tobacco because I think nicotine is relaxing. It's a nasty habit. ",,0.0,,2013-08-21 07:51:54,,,0,False,,,,0,,cbs5bep,,,,,t3_1kscyw,,,t1_cbs5bep,,,,t3_1kscyw,,,,,,,,1429754545.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

First of all, you alone or weak for feeling how you feel. You can ease up on yourself a little and know it's not weird or bad that you feel this way. It's also OKAY that you messed up and took a shortcut on some papers. I am not saying it's good, but the best people I know have still made mistakes. Self forgiveness does more to change behavior and provide willpower than self-criticism. It's a well-researched truth. 

Second, it sounds like you really need someone you can talk to openly. If your school provides counsellors, take advantage of them. It's hard being an island, but depression by nature makes you feel that's your only option. It's NOT. Talk to someone soon.

Last, look at some of your mental habits. What happens RIGHT before you start thinking these thoughts of worthlessness? Habits are always triggered by cues, even mental ones. The first step is to identify the cue. Don't worry immediately about changing, just identify what happens right before you start down this trail of thinking. Let me know if you can figure that out. 

Seriously bud. I don't know you, but I am positive you are not worthless. You are scared. Anxiety can be powerful. I didn't get into the school I wanted, and I took 8 years to get my bachelors degree. I married young and got divorced in that period. I felt worthless, but I felt that way because if I just sucked, I didn't have to try anymore. It would matter if it was just because I had no worth. I changed a couple habits, I decided to control what I could and forget what I couldn't control. It has only been a few years since then, and I am happily married to my best friend, we have two crazy kids, I make over $100k a year, I have a great degree and I am valuable. I help my family and friends, I love serving others. I am valuable and I always have been.

I would never commit suicide, and have never even considered it, but I just want to fast forward a few years. I spend almost all of my time browsing reddit or playing old school runescape. Fucking runescape, the game where you grind for hours upon hours to get imaginary experience, it's so pointless but addictive. I am very lonely most of the time, besides my mom and brother, who I am constantly annoyed by and very strongly dislike, respectively. 

Like I said, I'm 15 and live a lonely life. I have 2 friends that I've hung out with this summer a couple of times, but it's only every few weeks. My best friend however was my dad, but he unfortunately died from liver failure due to very excessive alcoholism after months of telltale symptoms of cirrhosis and denial. Shit even writing this I'm getting sad. About 2 months before he died he got a job with very good benefits after going from job to job, and with that job got a life insurance policy. He got fired for hitting something with a forklift while still on a probationary period, but died before the life insurance expired, leaving my brother over $100,000. I know my brother is a good enough guy that when he's 18 he'll give me half, so I'll hopefully be set when I'm 18.

My dad and I were incredibly good friends. I usually would spend every Saturday or Sunday with him in my grandma and grandpas basement, where he lived, watching TV. We would occasionally go see a movie or go bowling or something, which was even more fun. In the last few months I would look over and see my yellow dad asleep in the middle of the day with a cup of sprite and vodka on the table, which was really sad for me to see. 

Even writing this I feel like I'm having  a little angst party, but fuck it I'm continuing.

My dad was maybe too cool as a parent, as he started telling me about his college partying and drug dealing days when I was like 12. At the beginning of 2014 some friends (no longer friends) asked me to smoke weed with them, so I did. I told my dad and at first he was doing the normal dad reaction of ""wait until you're older"" but it quickly devolved into us smoking together a couple times a month, which just strengthened our bond. 

My mom found out that I was smoking weed with those friends, and forbade me from going to their houses anymore last Septemberish, so I was left very lonely. I found a reliable hookup for weed that delivered and got a portable vaporizer (little smell with odor eliminator) so from then on it was daily getting stoned in the basement and playing minecraft.

 I dabbled in psychedelics by myself a few times, but my last trip in October went kind of bad and I realized I was way too young to be doing such powerful drugs and how lame my life was. This further fucked up my overall happiness, so every time I got stoned it was just play minecraft and flatten out a normal world and listen to music to distract myself. 

I've also dabbled in amphetamines (just dextroamphetamine) which are fucking amazing, especially with weed, but I know they aren't good for your mind to be doing at 15, or at all, so stopped that in January.

Moving on from those irrelevant ramblings, I got high every night throughout October-January to cover up how lame my life was. In November a cousin of mine whole was slightly older than me died after a long battle with cancer, which I had known was going to happen for months so it didn't suck too badly, but still made me depressed for a little bit. 

I guess that whole period could be described as depressed, knowing the impending doom that was awaiting my dad because he too used substances to make his bad life better. Also knowing that a completely innocent teenager was going to die from something she had no control over fucked with me. I remember staying with my dad the night she died and him questioning why it had to be her instead of him, saying his life wasn't worth much and she had a full life ahead. I told him it was just random mutations and he said something like ""that's fucking bullshit"" back. My dad really had a later George Carlin attitude, constantly saying it's all bullshit

Anyway, my weed use continue through her death until January, when I decided to take a break, which left me feeling pretty good and seeing how badly weed was affecting me.

 In the beginning of February my mom and I got into a very heated argument over something trivial, which resulted in me having to stay at my grandparents for over a week. During that time I got even more insight into my dad's boring life, and he got fired that week. 

One day when I got home from school he wasn't there, but somehow managed to drive back about an hour later completely shitfaced and fell down the stairs to where I was, then stumbled over to the couch. He tried to tell me where he applied for a job, but was way too drunk to even form coherent words. My grandparents came down and asked how much he drank, to which he said just one 40 ounce. They continued asking questions until they realized he was too wasted. He then fell asleep for another hour and a half or so, then woke up and talked to me in a seemingly happy mood. I swear he repeated himself 3 times, but that's what alcohol does to you. Once he had sobered up a little more he remembered he had gotten fired from a very good paying job after months of applying everywhere. I remember these exact words ""Nobody wants me in this city, and I fucked up the one chance I had. I'm a horrible parent, sorry."" Just repeating he's a horrible parent over and over until he had to go throw up in the toilet. That day was possibly the worst in my life, even over the day he died. 

I made up with my mom and moved back in because living at my grandparents sucked, even though my dad did his best to make it good by buying me a bunch of awesome food and snacks and such. My dad admitted himself to the hospital the day I moved out since he knew something was wrong and still had health insurance, where he had over a .4 BAC and was told he had less than a year to live unless he got a transplant. The nurse even remembered him from a stay in August when he had bruising all over his torso due to less liver function. 

I only visited him twice, and the last time was February 7th. He died the 16th. I heard about his rapidly decreasing condition secondhand through my grandparents, aunts and uncles but was never courageous enough to see him myself, which I of course regret. 

I didn't go to school for 2 weeks but when I did I caught up very quickly. I honestly began to enjoy school, as it was incredibly easy and all of my teachers were really cool and I just had fun all around. Maybe it was due to the human interaction and me being kind of the class clown (god I fucking hate that term but it's true) in a lot of my classes. 

In March I started the reefer again until the beginning of May when I got caught by my mom yet again, but didn't get everything confiscated. My brother found out I still had other stuff, so he beat the shit out of me and gave my mom all of it. 

Tonight my mom really fucking pissed me off, essentially interrogating me about the dates of a vacation that I didn't know that I'm going on with my dad's side of the family. She got really pissed because of something snarky my grandpa said to her that she deserves for being such a worry some lady, and ended up yelling at me, pulling the victim card saying she never knows what's going on, then ended up crying. Most of the time I know she has good intentions but just goes about things in the most annoying way possible. 

I don't even want to get started on my brother. He's like the complete opposite of me, aggressive, angry on the outside, mean, gets mad at the most trivial things, close minded can't have a rational debate without getting mad and rolling his eyes. He's just a fuckin dick and I can't wait until he joins the military after graduating. 

So now here I am, pissing away my summer days on things that don't matter at all in the longterm. Like I said I've gathered with friends a couple times and really would like to again, but don't know how to confront them about it. I don't want to invite them to my dilapidated old house we are about to get foreclosed out of or invite myself over. I don't know how to approach women without being very uncomfortable, but would definitely like to. I use sarcasm as a defense mechanism so people don't know my real boring personality I think, and that doesn't go well with girls.

I'm very good friends with a mostly closeted gay guy (even though he has a typical gay voice) who I've known for years, and wouldn't mind hooking up with him either, but haven't told him and want to in person. The problem is though, I feel like my older brother would be very judgemental about my hanging out with such an effeminate person. I told him we can get together and get drunk sometime this summer, and need to follow through though. Who knows, maybe it'll lead to drunkenly confessing our love for each other and handies.

 I know for some people being bisexual would be a source of distress, but I don't give a fuck at all. My moms side of the family is very liberal so when I eventually decide come out they'll be cool, and my dad's is more classic conservatives but it doesn't matter. 

If you read all of that, sorry for putting you through so much information about my dad. He was of course very important to me, and is one of the main sources of my sadness nowadays. If you can give me any advice on how to approach friends I would appreciate it a lot. I hope you are all doing well and thanks for taking time out of your life to read such boring bullshit, goodnight.

I just searched through reddit and found this community, because I don't know where else to go.  If I talk to anyone about what I've been feeling, they generally tell me to just get over it.  But, I'm convinced I'm not feeling normal, and I really haven't been for a long time.  Sorry for the rant.

Things have been worse these past few months.  I'm either sad or stressed all of the time.  Even when I do things that should make me happy, I feel empty, like nothing.  There's a girl who I hVe feelings for, and I just haven't bothered to message her back when she texts me.  I barely bring myself to text back my friends and family either, because I just don't care.  

I feel tired all of the time.  When my alarm goes off, I just lay in bed.  I'm always 15 minutes late everywhere, because I'm tired and I never feel motivated to leave until I'm already late.  All I want to do is just lay around doing nothing; even watching my old favorite TV shows just does nothing for me.  The only time I ever feel motivated to do anything is when I panic.

All I ever think about is feeling sad.  I'm questioning my entire life: my interests, the career I thought I wanted, my religion...I've been thinking about hell a lot, and how afraid I am of most of my friends going there.  I've been angry about an unjust God.

I don't like my old favorite foods.  I dread eating because everything seems stale.  I'm tired all the time.  I have trouble talking to people when I didn't used to; I can't ever think of anything to say, even with my best friends.  The list just goes on.

Is it possible that bad events can trigger depression?  I've felt like this in the past when things go poorly.  These past couple months I've been treated like shit at my job where I work long hours and get nothing for it, I've had a couple bad fallout with girls I wanted to date, wrecked my car, basically just been stomped on at every front nonstop.

I'm in a fraternity with 60 other guys so I've got friends but it feels incredibly empty to me.  I poor my heart out to some of them and they still act the same, empty hello's or how's it going.  I started to go to counseling since its free at my college.  I can't stop crying when I talk to my 1on1 therapist/counselor but yet the group sessions have been 50/50 so far.  I don't know how long I've felt this way.  I've only started to own up to it in the past two months or so.  Last semester I blamed everything on my ex-gf breaking up with me in September.  First week of group session cleared that up and that's when it hit me that there's a ton of more stuff wrong with me.  Nothing is fun anymore, either staying at home drinking and playing games/watching movies or hanging out with my ""brothers/friends"".  Its just all the same to me so I have no motivation to go out and try to have fun.  I think I've been here 10 minutes typing this so far.  It kinda feels like a journal almost.  Trying to connect my relevant feelings/experiences with you to help you.  I can barely eat.  I didn't eat at all Sunday, Monday was some crackers.  Kind of the opposite of you I guess.  It just seems like so much work to actually go to the food place, order food, place the food in my mouth and chew to eat.  I can feel hungry some times but not feel the urge/need to eat.  Every person I meet I feel like I'm judging them as to whether or not they can help me.  Because of my ex and her shit, I feel like I can't trust any girl ever again, I'll always be second guessing everything that is said/unsaid.  I think I just need to find somebody else that makes me happy, even vaguely.  But then I'll be holding her afar hoping I won't get hurt; therefore its not fair to me or her so what's the point in trying to have another relationship.  Plus with this last one, I tried to make a list of what me happy while with her.  I could only come up with a list of like 5 or 6 things.  Smile, Eyes, NHL passion, AHL passion, video games.  With the list so small it made me think of the few sessions I had with my counselor and my past.  I'm just trying to find somebody that want's me, to listen to me and love me.  And that's why I'm scared of looking for somebody else.  What if I throw myself at them the minute they start showing affection?  I'll just fill a void that might go away, again.  I still haven't come out to being depressed to my family.  Alcoholic dad that is finally sober and trying to fix our relationship makes it a little hard.  I don't wanna let them down even though I feel like a huge disappointment to them despite doing 1000x better than them at school.  I don't even know how I'd approach it, my reaction to telling them or their reaction/reasoning.

Sorry for the long post.  I've been trying to talk here for awhile and have written before but always ended up deleting my post before posting it thinking there's no way this may help them.

I'm a 20 y/o senior in college majoring in bioengineering and currently applying to graduate schools. I've been a pretty good student so far through college, getting a 3.51 gpa. But now, I'm facing a wall in that this first semester of my senior year has been atrociously difficult, where i've seriously overloaded myself. I've already failed one class, luckily i can retake it before i graduate with no real penalty. However, I'm seriously afraid of doing terribly in a fluid mechanics class that is a requirement for my major. If i dont pass/get a high enough grade to count for credit, I have to retake the class, except i'd have to stay for an extra semester. While im sure many people have had this problem in the past, its really bringing me down that its come to this. I'm meeting my professor who claims that ""there's a method to his madness of finals grades"" which makes me feel like i may come out okay in the end, but i really dont know. 

My semesters been killing me as i've rarely seen anyone, save my girlfriend, due to the fact that im either constantly working or studying. I've lost all my friends either due to this time commitment or due to graduation. My best friend went missing in october, I later found out he was hospitalized and is now staying in oregon with family, but I have no idea what actually happened to him as he's been on his family's schedule more than anything else. My grandmother, who played a big role in raising me as a kid passed away last week, and the stress and grief is really bringing me down.

I'm worried about repeating this fluid mechanics class as I feel that any hope for grad school will be thrown out the window once people find out why im sticking around undergrad for another semester. While there are worse things in life, its incredibly depressing that the one thing i've always wanted to do may become impossible for me to do. Not to mention the fact that my parents have no understanding when it comes to these matters. 

I'm going to cut this a bit short as I'm rambling, but I could really use some words of wisdom, pick-me-ups, anything that'll cheer me up as I wait tediously for my thursday meeting with my prof to, essentially, determine my fate.

I also still live with my parents and 3 younger siblings, so as you can imagine I have a good sum of money.  So I don't have to worry about money very often.  While not having to worry about money helps in the stress department, there is nothing that money can do to treat my depression symptoms. For me, the symptoms are also getting worse for some reason as I've had some very concerning episodes in the last 12 months.  But I don't want to go back the medications, as those usually cause more issues than they are worth, and their effectiveness is limited.  

Are you experiencing a lot of financial stress?  Do you feel like that is the only thing holding you back?  Are you sure you actually have depression?  Numerous people get mis-diagnosed for depression every year only to go on medications, experience mania from those meds for a short time, but in the end it does them harm.

I was, at a young age, ruined. Overprotection turned me into a nervous, depressive emotional train wreck of a human being. That is the heart of the problem. I was pulled out of public school and sent to a school for kids with problems. I never fit in there. I was the only student without a parole officer. These kids were violent.

I was so anxious and nervous. I never talked. I felt awful about myself. I let all my friends drift away, and never bothered to ask them to hang out. I was too shy. I lost them all.

I lost too much time in that place. I turned to video games to entertain and escape. I look back and shudder. 1600 hours in Guild Wars, easily. While other kids were out with friends and getting first kisses and fucking up and learning lessons, I was at home playing Guild Wars. 

I have broken out of that cycle. I work out. I look good. Or at least not bad. I hardly play video games anymore, unless I have time to kill. I have become less shy, and tried to be more social. But I still have no friends. I still am too socially maladjusted. People do not ask me to hang out.

I've never had a serious relationship. Girlfriends, sure. Looking back I realize these relationships were fucked up. But I was OK with that at the time. Now it just feels like a waste. 

I have a bleeding heart. I meet a girl and instantly fall head over heels in like before ever getting to really know her. Every time. And every time, she is entering a relationship with someone else. Every time. No matter how I try to get her attention, no matter how well we get along. I cannot win.

This is a chronic problem. Recently, again, I grew to really care about a girl I knew almost nothing about. I knew what would happen. I knew I was going to get hurt again from the very start. I even cried because I didn't want these feelings for her. I did not want to love, because it is always, always followed by hurt. But you cannot control these things.

People do not want my company. I have tried to make new friends, worked hard on improving myself and being more agreeable. I ask them to hang out. They will. But they never call *me*. Never text. The onus is always on *me*. My company is not worth their time.

I wonder if I am crazy. Sometimes I wonder if I have some kind of high functioning aspergers. I wonder why nobody will be my friend. Why no girls want me. People are friendly with me, girls sometimes flirt. But I cannot build close friendships. Any interest in me fades quick. I don't know why.

I just want to write. To express it. I don't know what I expect to get out of this. I just want the feeling of emptiness inside of me to go away. I think I do it to myself. I'm sure there is a million more things I could write. Mostly, though, I want to feel wanted.

So a lot of times when I'm in a particularly bad place or having some serious suicidal thoughts, there's an additional impetus to kill myself because of the idea that, whether successful or not, attempting suicide would legitimize my depression, thereby justifying all of my general shittiness/worthlessness when I'm depressed.

My friends don't believe me when I try to explain to them what its like, and that all I want is a reason to be anything more than a drain of precious resources. 

I sat watching the clock from 6 am til now slowly pass, missing my afternoon Honours class since I couldnt bring myself to get out of bed and on the bus to my college 10 mins away. 

I place value on my self based on a (false) sense of belonging, whether I'm wanted as a peer or used as a tool I need un raison d'etre (reason to be, to exist)

I  realized when I stopped partying and abusing drugs that my friends weren't interested in hanging out with me. 

I felt so alone and down on my luck (I was having trouble with bills and school) but realized that if substances have to be around in order for my friends to hang out with me, then they aren't really invested in our friendship...they're just concerned about when and where they'll get more drugs, sell more drugs, or ""have a good time"" and make sure other people see them doing these things so that their actions get validated.

Not sure the area you live in but it sounds like you need to have a car in order to get anywhere? Is anything within biking distance? Try doing things online through mturk, it's chump change but is legit and if you aren't spending your time doing anything else then you might as well be doing tasks for a few dollars at a time. O desk is another one (might be one word: odesk). Do you have any family that can give you a ride into town to look for jobs? Or ones who could give you a ride to an interview if you got one set up?

You also might want to try selling some stuff on craigslist or eBay. It sucks but if you're pressed for cash and need to make ends meet, you can try selling gaming systems or something like that. I recently sold all the digital cameras I have since I have one on my phone in order to make my rent. 

/r/loans is also a helpful place. I got $200 in order to also help me make my rent. Read the rules there before posting and give a realistic timeframe for when you can pay the person back. Many people ask for loans and offer to pay back with interest but that's not required. /r/assistance is another resource, perhaps you can find someone to give you rides or help out with your car.

1056,,True,pi3832v2,,,,"From said essay:

&gt;For instance, if we suffer very great bodily pain, or if the pain lasts a long time, we become indifferent to all other troubles: our recovery is what we desire most dearly. In the same way, great mental suffering makes us insensible to bodily suffering: we despise it. Nay, if it outweighs the other, we find it a beneficial distraction, a pause in our mental suffering. And so it is that suicide becomes easy; for the bodily pain that is bound up with it loses all importance in the eyes of one who is tormented by excessive mental suffering. This is particularly obvious in the case of those who are driven to commit suicide through some purely morbid and discordant feeling. They have no feelings to overcome; they do not need to rush at it, but as soon as the keeper who looks after them leaves them for two minutes they quickly put an end to their life.

That strikes a chord.  I've endured, if not ""great"", but at least significant physical pains at points in my life, and they never lead to thoughts of suicide.  Feelings of rage and violence at times, but never suicide.  And I have experience the pleasurable distraction from mental discord that physical pain can bring--i.e., cutting.

But, the rest of the essay seems to be mostly concerned with arguing against the civil criminalization of suicide, and the moral demonization of suicide in the churches.

I spent two months unemployed, living with either my dad/stepmom/baby sister or my mother, who has mental issues. She's not a great person but I had nowhere to go.

 My dad and stepmom didn't want me around and were trying to teach me hard life lessons by kicking me out. In March of 2014 I started gaining weight and am now twenty pounds heavier than I was when I graduated college, so that makes me feel cruddy all the time, also not fitting into my own clothes. I was active, I had friends, I did things, worked out, slept well, was not on drugs... healthy, happy, hopeful. I finally figured out how to be alive.

Anyway. Gained weight. Started eating crap. Stopped working out. Stopped sleeping. Now I'm addicted to pastries and such. I think late March is when the depression and anxiety started creeping back. I had a college degree, no job, and no plan. I am discovering the degree to be worthless yet I am paying the student loans for it. (Back story: insane mother lives near the university I went to and blackmailed me to go there). I worked at [unnamed music retail chain] for six months and was totally miserable, although that's where and when I met my SO and we've been together for eight months. Silver lining there. I didn't belong working there, faced sexual harassment from dozens of clients, and now that I work at [unnamed massage studio chain] I feel like I don't belong ANYWHERE. I'm the top worker here, however, and just a few minutes ago confessed my struggle with depression and anxiety to a manager who confronted me about my negativity and irritability. 

When I was in college, I had it under control. I was happy and healthy and looking forward to the things my life had to bring, but I felt like 2014 was a completely wasted year for me. I barely touched my music, and now I feel utterly lost without it. I don't know who I am. It's all I've ever been. If I don't get to pursue it, I'm not a person. 
Friends tell me I can pursue music if I really want to. The thing is, I have no energy, focus, inspiration. That's what depression does. It turns you into a vegetable; a vegetable who no longer enjoys sticking its roots in the ground and growing. My music doesn't grow with me anymore. It is leaking out of me, abandoning me. I guess in a way I'm mourning the person I was right before I graduated college, the girl who had it all figured out.

My job is unsatisfying and without challenge, I'm once again unhappy with my body, I can't sleep without drugs, I don't do the things I love to do. I don't hang out with my friends. I black out, wake up, go to work, sit at a computer, do nothing, then go home. I want to blame it on the winter. Seasonal Affective Disorder is something I've suffered from in the past, but never to this degree of severity. Ironic because my senior capstone project was all about SAD. The apartment we live in is dark and dirty and a little sketchier than I would like. We call it the black hole because when you walk in, the apartment feels like it's pushing you down to the ground and makes us not want to do anything. We can't control the heat. The management turns it on as they see fit. Rent in Colorado is too expensive for even the SO and I to have our own one bedroom living on our minimum wage jobs. 
I'm trying to figure out how to pull myself out of this slump. I've been unable to make a decision for months: about where to live, whether or not I want to go back to school, and if so, what for. I can't make one decision. My brain is made up of scrambled eggs and oatmeal. I have been lurking on Reddit for years so maybe someone will have something productive to say that I haven't thought of yet... all I do is make excuses and I've never been so hopeless/irritable/angry/lost in my life. 

Sorry if my thoughts seem jumbled. This is how my brain functions nowadays. 
Also, if it's important, I've been detoxing off of marijuana for the last five days in an effort to find a new job (just in case of drug test) so I've read that withdrawal may exacerbate my symptoms.

TL;DR - had my life together before graduating college, it all fell apart afterwards, having difficulty finding my place and suffering from depression and anxiety.

I think I've maybe commented in here once or twice before, but I've never posted, and am definitely not a known name or anything. But I just wanted to write. And I felt like this was the perfect place.

I'm 25, a dude. I've been in inpatient behavioral care, and I'm in a Partial program right now. I've been heavily battling depression for over a year now, and been dealing with it a little for years and years. I didn't consider myself having a strong mental disorder until I was hospitalized for it.

Anyway.... I found out today that my insurance is only paying for one more day of Partial, so I have to be done tomorrow. I've been in it for barely over a week. I feel like the group therapy it provides hasn't done me a great deal of good because some of the people with more trauma or worse experiences than mine took up a lot of the time, and I didn't get the 1 on 1 care I felt I needed. I'm left wondering if my life is going to constantly be made up of these hospital trips or programs like Partial. If it is... I dont know if I can do it. 

I know that this is something to be attacked and battled, but I'm so exhausted. I have moments where I feel positive, and I think ""I can beat this"". But then I have moments like now, where I picture the older folks that I met in my programs, and I wonder if I'm going to end up like them. I just feel like... If the latter is my future, I can't let myself get there. And whether I beat this, or I have to end my life, I just want a way out.

I just know there are people here who have been in my shoes and get it. I dont know if I want to chat, or just rant, or what... I like to listen though as much as I like to be heard.

It does a good job of explaining how and why some of the usual feedback depressed people get is frustrating.

An important disclaimer: stuff I'm about to write is from my personal experience with depression. I don't know how your friend is doing, and my advice might just not apply to your situation. Take what's useful, leave what isn't.

For me personally, it's nice when I can talk about being depressed without feeling like I'm bringing people down or worrying them needlessly or implying that they should be doing something solve my problems. So, if your friend is like me, then you shouldn't make depression a Big Thing.

Compare it to a chronic physical problem. If your friend has regular back pain, and it interferes with their life, what can you do for them? Let them complain about it to you. Help them out on days when they need to move a lot of heavy stuff, or when their back is extra-painful. Expect them to be irritable sometimes and don't hold it against them. Just don't make it the center of your relationship.

None of the stuff up there is about getting rid of chronic back pain, it's about being a good friend to someone with chronic back pain. If you really want to help them get rid of it, it's easier and more respectful if they actually want your help. If your friend isn't seeing a doctor already, probably the best thing you can do is get them to see one. Sure, maybe you can suggest some remedies that you read somewhere on the internet, and you might even find some your friend hasn't tried already, but an expert's help is a lot more likely to get somewhere, whether it's depression or back pain we're talking about.

With depression, though, the sort of things you do to deal with it can benefit quite a bit just from regular contact with a comfortable nonjudgemental outside person. For example, if your friend is trying to get out of bed by 9 every day, they might want to set up a thing where they tell you whether they did that or not every day.

But again, be careful about coming on too strong. Depression biases people into making negative self-blaming interpretations of things. Where a normal person might think ""I'm glad I have friends who are happy help me out"", a depressed person might instead think ""I'm annoyed that I'm wasting my friends' time and energy with this"".

Going out alone allows me to be around people without being burdened by negative people who often bring me down. I'm an introvert though.

I hope you keep working on things like these! After a while you may find a liberating freedom from doing things alone. And guess, what? Someday someone will let on that they admire you for being able to do these things on your own, and admit that they couldn't.

I was just dumped, minutes ago, by my boyfriend. I loved him with all my heart and was actually the one who had saved me from suicide not too long ago. It was all just a silly cliche.
He saved me and had talked to me for hours, and before we knew it we were basically spending every waking moment talking to each other and doing things for each other such as getting each other gifts and sharing most our time and efforts together.
He became the sole reason I even felt it was worth to stay alive anymore, though I never told him out of fear that such pressure would strain him.
I always told him how I feared that when we moved in together, which we were to do on September, that he may end up too exposed to my issues and end up disliking me and dumping me, to which he always responded ""We will work it out. I promise"" on several occasions, which only made me happier.
Needless to say, I was still dealing with my inner demons of which I warned him about and was doing my best to resolve it.
I didn't apply for my next school term so I could make enough money in working so as to move in by the planned time, and I thanked him every three days or so, just out of impulse, for everything he has done for me and the care and love he gave me.

Soon after I met his friends, to which he was very close and even made a group of them on Skype. I was ( apparently ), initially popular with them, but it didn't take long for them to grow tired of me.
I grew to dislike the group heavily, my boyfriend was the leader of sorts of the group, and in his little ""moderations"" he often ignored me to the point where he outright said he knew he was neglecting me and apologized.
This apology was two days prior.

Today ( in the night before actually ), I left the group in a fit of anger from the fact that someone would not stop yelling despite my requests of them calming down. My boyfriend promptly scolded me for my actions, to which I explained why I did it and apologized to him.

A few hours later, actually quite a few. A good five to six. I was beginning to have a meltdown from the terror off the thought that he may leave me, gushing my feelings to someone who I thought was my enemy but apparently, by suffering the same thing, ended up becoming fast friends. He helped me and tried to make me feel better during it, understanding that I was spilling, and then notified me that he was kicked from the group since my boyfriend wanted to discuss ""emotional things"" with his inner circle.

I panicked further.

All behind his back so he wouldn't know, I was in absolute tears and terrified of losing him. It wasn't long until the friend I was gushing to began to panic as well, taking my meltdown badly and explaining to my boyfriend that it was getting bad.
My boyfriend, finishing the discussion, then came to me saying he had once loved me but he can't keep up anymore, and that he was sorry.
The quote that stung me the most was:
""I just had no idea that someone's depressive tendencies were so... infectious.""

After my constant pleads for a second chance and begging for forgiveness, he denied me and cut all contact with me.

It’s going to be hard for me to type out, probably seem long winded at some parts, but I really need to say all of this to someone.

**TL;DR:** Move to new city for new job. Go off depression/adhd meds. Get amazing girl. Girl’s mother passes. My grandfather passes. I miss his funeral. I go into bad depression where I don’t know how to operate normally. Girlfriend and I in rough patch. Get therapist help. Get put on improvement plan at work. Travel. Girlfriend and I break off romantic part of relationship. Get terminated from work. Feel lost in my mind and in life.

**My background:**

I grew up not being coddled, but living a decent life and we never struggled too much financially. I am the youngest of three, and felt like growing up I was always given the short stick amongst my brothers. My eldest brother was brilliantly smart and my middle brother a start athlete. I had taken on traits from both of them, but never fit in really with either crowd.

I’ve lived away from my hometown – where my parents and all of my extended family live – for the past 6 years. No doubt, this has worn on me as we are very close and I am always hearing about the get-togethers. 

**Where I am now:**

Now I’m a mid-twenty male living over 1,000 miles from home. Last July, I made the decision to go off of my daily medication of Lexapro (20mg) and Concerta (28mg?). I had just moved to a new city for an increased role at a company I was with for 3 years, feeling great about the increase paycheck and responsibility, and felt like nothing could stop me. 

I thought that after 7 years of being on medication, maybe I had been cured and didn’t need to rely on them anymore. So I made an appointment with a psychiatrist since I read online you should wean yourself off of the medication. 

My first mistake was that I met with a Psychiatrist who I would call a “scrip doctor.” Essentially, I walked into the appointment told him I had been on medicine for 7 years, was feeling great, and that I wanted to taper off. He wrote me a prescription for the Lexapro to go down over 3 or 4 weeks’ time and I would be good as golden! 

*General Happiness is about an 8 out of 10 and Focus at work 7 out of 10.* 

**Life increases and I meet Y**

Around this same time I met an amazing girl, who we will call Y, who I clicked with so well. I became enthralled with her and felt like I had someone who finally got me. We were two peas in a pod that just felt perfect next to one another. Words can’t really even begin to explain the emotions that I felt when I am with her.

About a month later things did go smoothly for about a month after not being on medication. I did notice a slight lack of being able to pay attention at work so I would occasional take a spare Concerta I had left over; no big deal. I did however find out that Y had also recently moved to the area was because her mother was dying of cancer and moved they moved in with a relative. She had been already battling it for a while, so they knew that she was only going to be around for a few months to a year or so.

*One month after being off medication – General Happiness is about a 7 out of 10 and Focus at Work 5 out of 10.*

**Together, but Bad News**

August and September held only Y and I growing even closer together. I start to hang out with her more than I hang out with my few friends that I already had down here as they’re doing the same with others they are dating. 

Toward mid-October things aren’t going well for Y’s mom and I’m worried. I start to look into how to help console someone who has a sick parent and what to do when the parent does pass. Then the unthinkable happens and she passes away a week or two later. I knew the best thing I could do at this point was to let her know whatever she needed I was there for her. Her mom was her best friend – Y had spent the past few years going to college while taking care of her mom at the same time. They grew so much over the past years.

Y was always a rock when I was around her and one of the toughest people I know, but this shook event obviously shook her world so much that I felt like I could see the deterioration of a human being both physically and mentally. Y appears to be a trooper to many throughout though and never really lets anyone besides me see how she really is feeling, and I know she is still holding back on her emotions.

*General Happiness is about a 5 out of 10 and Focus at work 4 out of 10.*

**Is this all really happening?**

About a month later its Thanksgiving time and I am excited to go home and see my family. I haven’t seen all of them in nearly a full year and I am excited to get back to home. Everything is great about the trip, but my grandfather is now on oxygen and running out of breath very easily. My parents told me about this so it wasn’t that big of a shock. 

About two weeks after Thanksgiving I’m back 1,000 miles away and get a call from my Dad. He tells me that my grandfather fell and was on the floor for hours before anyone found him. They brought him to the hospital where they were running tests, and they didn’t look good. Within a few days he had passed. I was happy that I got to see him over Thanksgiving, but this was just so sudden and to me unexpected. This was a man who our backyards touched growing up. A man who loved me to death and always made sure I worked my hardest. I decided I wouldn’t fly home for the funeral as he was being cremated, I didn’t have the money to fly home on short notice, and I felt guilty taking time off from work after taking off so much during Thanksgiving. I would be home again later that month anyway for Xmas. 

*General Happiness is about a 3 out of 10 and Focus at work 2 out of 10.*

**What's this life for? Get it Together Man**

Y and I both fell into a depression. We fight, break up, and make up a couple of times quickly in between November and January. We also pretty much live with each other, and see each other every day. We spend 6 out of 7 nights together at one of our houses. I don’t know if it’s because we don’t want to be alone, or because we don’t trust each other with ourselves right now. 

I really don’t remember much of early December through early February. I would go to work, feel like I was in a daze, come home and smoke pot with Y, then go to sleep:

When I woke up – I didn’t want to go to work. When I was at work, I didn’t want to be there. I couldn’t see a window from my cubicle so I bought a SAD lamp hoping that would help and it did to an extent, but I had no actual sunlight. I didn’t want to be at work, and all I wanted to do was be with Y. 

In late Feb Y and I have a really big fight. I’m slowly realizing I’m going off of my rocker and I need to see a therapist. I make an appointment and finally start to find some solace in talking with someone. After three sessions in four weeks I had already started to improve my work and focus as I was able to talk with someone about my problems. Then I was put on an improvement plan at work, but my boss never saw eye to eye anyway so I thought this was a way to get more engagement out of me. I let him know that I agreed to the goals and wanted to have better communication amongst each other and he seemed happy with that. 

*General Happiness is about a 4 out of 10 and Focus at work 5 out of 10.*

**Stomaching my Work Before Heading Off**

Now it’s April. I wake up stressed about getting fired at work every day, I go to work and worry about being fired at any minute, I come home and think about getting fired until I can finally worry myself to sleep. Y and I are still with each other every day and night nearly. Things aren’t the same as they used to be you can tell, but we have so many life stressors that it could be anything at this point. I’m especially nervous as I’m flying to a third world country for a wedding in the coming weeks and I’ve developed claustrophobia and have minor panic attacks now since going off of medicine. I could tell something was off with Y the week before I left for my trip, but I shook it off. I was too afraid to say anything about it because I didn’t want to lose her.

*General Happiness is about a 6 out of 10 and Focus at work 6 out of 10.*

**Its for Real this Time**

I come home and Y picks me up from the airport. Things are tense as we didn’t talk much when I was gone. She tells me she’s had some time to think about things and that we haven’t been focusing on ourselves enough, and to this I agree. She wants to break up because it’s the only way we’ll actually spend time apart. I breakdown in the car. I’m bawling my eyes out. She makes me stay the night with her because she doesn’t trust me enough and I don’t want to be alone. We agree we need to spend time apart.

*General Happiness is about a 2 out of 10 and Focus at work 5 out of 10.*

**How Did it Come to This**

At this point I’m lost. So I talk with HR in my company and let them know nearly everything life wise that has been going on. I let them know that this is the reason why I have been performing so poorly, and that I am trying to make a change. I want to be a better person and be a better employee. This is about 30 days after my improvement plan started. HR is respectful and asks if I’ve shared it with my boss yet (I hadn’t). 3 days later I let my boss know what I was going through. He said he had no idea and was taken back by it. 
At this time I also decide that I am going back on anxiety/depression medication. I go and get a prescription from where I’ve been seeing my therapist and it starts to help.

Y and I have been seeing each other, and have a friends with benefits relationship for a few weeks. Y doesn’t have friends down here because she had been focused on her mother’s health and me for so long that she never had time. It’s a little odd, but we know each other so much better than anyone else does. Then she decides that she doesn’t want to be romantically involved with me anymore and wants to be celibate. I still think this is a good idea because I know I need to work on myself just like she does so we agree to it. However, we still hang out a few times a week at this point and stay over at each other’s place frequently. 

*General Happiness is about a 3.5 out of 10 and Focus at work 6 out of 10.*

**I Really Can't Believe it...**

Two weeks ago I get into work. My boss had been out the week before and he had scheduled a catch-up meeting a few weeks prior so we could talk about my projects. The day is going normal and then 2PM rolls around and I get nervous when my boss says we’ll be taking our meeting to the conference room instead of his office. I walk in and it is the HR person I talked with in the previous month on the phone and my boss sitting across the table. HR says, “Okay so last month I know you talked with me about your depression and anxiety, we talked about possibly taking short term disability, and what your options are. Your boss also let me know that you had talked to him about your problems as well.” Alright, I’m figuring this may just be a catch up call with HR too. My boss then says, “It’s been about 45 days since you’ve started your improvement plan, and while we’ve seen an increase in attitude and increase in work output, you’re just not doing enough of your research. For this reason we are letting you go. I will now bring in the local HR person and you will be able to grab a few things from your desk and escorted from the building.” He gets up and walks out and sends in the HR rep. 

I’m shocked. I did not see this coming. I know I was improving work and I know my boss was seeing my output increase. I had a million things running through my head and she goes “here’s your letter of termination, some information on benefits, and do you have any questions.” No severance (after 4 years with them), no warnings besides the initial meeting for the improvement plan, and I’m just bewildered. 

I call Y on the way home and she helped me through the week and stayed with me. We haven’t been romantically involved since before, and she’s not interested in me that way anymore. I feel worthless at this point – I’m recently single and jobless. My lease ends in 2 weeks so I have to move out into the burbs with a friend’s friend of the current city I’m living in because I would like to find a job to stay around my friends and Y here. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, what I do from here? I feel like a slate that could be wiped clean and I could move home and abandon all hope for this city I’ve started to root myself into. But at the same time I’ve started to learn to love it here, and I have my friends and Y I can rely on here where I don’t have anyone like that at home besides family. 

I feel like I have no direction or drive. I do not feel happy, but not sad. I feel lost in my mind, and lost in life. No matter what I do, I feel like it will be the wrong decision. The most important thing is that I do not feel suicidal, but I just feel numb.

I know this was a long story, and I don’t know if anyone will read it, but I hope that someone is able to relate or has some advice.

I'm shy even on the Internet, but when I have been taking them and calmed down, I feel so much more relaxed and social. I'm aware of the possible addiction, so I try not to take too many pills at once. So I'm writing this down now when I feel okay, content and relaxed.

So, a new school year started this week, and it actually hasn't been bad at all. I'm on my meds, daily escitalopram and occasional benzos for anxiety. I was officially diagnosed with depression at the end of last year, and have been taking meds ever since. They actually have helped me. They made feel better. Almost normal. 

Before the school semester ended this May, my doctor told me that I was no longer fit in the criteria... how to explain this in English... according to the test I made in the doctor's office, I am no longer depressed. Of course the doctor said I still have to take my meds. But... truth to be told, I'm really really ashamed of this illness of mine. I want to stop taking the meds. But I don't think that's a possibility yet. And I haven't taken them very regularly anymore lately. Should I confess this to my doctor? I know that it's a big mistake, but I just want to be mentally healthy again. My suicidal thought are pretty much gone, but I still have these urges to hurt myself. And these sudden crying fits... When I have those, I feel like I could burst or blow up from the inside and I just want to sleep forever. Never waking up. I daydream of suicide sometimes, not too often, but I just wonder what would it feel like to never wake up. 

I spent the summer in my parent's place. It went fine, actually. I didn't have many bad or harmful thoughts. I love my parents, but I really need my own time and place and own peace. And I didn't have that there. But now that I'm back in my own apartment, I almost miss my parents. I really do love them. They are my comfort and hope and I'm really grateful that they care about me, they try to understand what I'm going through... Not everyone has that, and I'm just really happy that I do. 

And one more thing. I found someone. I have crush on him. But during the last few days I am not sure does he really care about me. This is my first relationship, but this constant gnawing feeling inside tells me that he does not care about me. He's busy with school and friends and whatever, we don't live in the same city, the distance between us is like 400 kilometers and during this weekend (it's Sunday evening here right now) I just couldn't help but cry. I sorta expected him to come over to my place (I don't have a car and the bus connections from my city to his are pretty nonexistant.) Today he told that he was not able to come to see me and... I kind of broke. I was expecting to see him and when we didn't I felt like shit. I don't want to seen as a clingy girlfriend, so I haven't send him thousands of messages. As I'm writing this I'm starting to realize what a mess I am. I'm slowly starting to realize that this my fault. And it's bringing me down even more.

 I've seen this happen to very close friends and destroy everyone involved so many times, where the cheating partner uses the ""I need SPACE"" excuse. What they really mean is, ""I am not willing to give up either one of you. So I'll just put you ""on hold"" while I do whatever I want. Then come back whenever I want"" They're selfish unsympathetic greedy human beings who will do whatever they please, at the cost of other people's feelings and lives. They do not even have the respect to end the relationship properly. They will always try to victimize themselves and justify what they are doing.


 I WILL call it RIGHT NOW. When that relationship fails, which it will, she'll be crawling back to you. ""O, I made a mistake. I just wanted to see what would happen but  you were *always* the one for me. I was just confused"". Bullshit. 

 But seriously you should be glad you DIDN'T marry this kind of selfish narcissistic person who is unable to think about other people's feelings. If you want to talk, PM me. I am outraged by this behaviour as I know several people like this. Almost exactly the same thing- cheating on their SO with a married persons (one of them did this repeatedly even after being forgiven). I am just SO sick of people who think they can just do this to other people.

I can't kill myself because I'm scared of the potential consequences. I can run away though.

It hurts me tremendously when I hear people talking about sex and intimacy nonchalantly, because that's the only thing I want in my life but I never ever ever get it.

I'm not saying it's a good feeling to have, but what I mean is that we all experience moments when we desire to be like somebody else or have something that somebody else has. 

Whenever I think like this or feel like this, I just tell myself, ""Okay, maybe you're not as good looking as that person. *So what?*"" Being beautiful, or being talented, or having a great body doesn't have any relevance in whether or not somebody should care for you or love you. If somebody lets those kind of things influence their attitude towards another person, then I would question the kind of ""friend"" they are. 

A sad reality of this world is that some people just suffer from a lot of unfortunate circumstances. You could be a wonderful person, but it's very possible that you might not have a great life. It happens, and it *sucks*. 

Don't write your problems off as ""teenage hormonal problems"", because if your feelings are hurt, then it's kind of a big deal! The fact that your family cares for you is one positive, isn't it? That's something, at least. Some people don't even have their family's support during times like this.

I was dumped 3 weeks ago after 14 months of awesomeness. My now ex-boyfriend had been dealing with anxiety and mild depression for a while and then all of a sudden--KABOOM. It was like he self-imploded. He made me breakfast in the morning and broke up with me (he was sobbing and completely hysterical) later that evening saying he didn't know why, but suddenly he felt nothing towards our relationship. We tried to work it out for a week, but it was tense and horrible. I was waiting for him to try and remember that he loved me, and he was just completely numb. He finally broke it off saying he just wasn't ready for the sacrifices of a relationship, that he couldn't handle my emotions linked to his, and that he didn't have the emotional capacity to try any longer. He said he needed to work on himself and that he hopes one day we can be friends. He's making plans now to move away from the city we live in because it reminds him too much of me. 

This has been hard for me to deal with because it seemed to come out of nowhere. The week before he told me I was the love of his life, that he wanted to marry me, and that he hoped we could move in together. I can't help but suspect this sudden change of heart is a result of external factors. He's been dealing with unhappiness about his job and future job prospects for a while, but never once did it come up that some of his unhappiness was about our relationship. This has been a stressful month for me in terms of my own career and deadlines, and now I  feel like I dropped the ball on our relationship somehow. 

I get that depression and anxiety in combination with job dissatisfaction are sticky things to deal with, but I wish he would let me support him while he went through it. He said he just couldn't handle the guilt of what it was doing to me. 

I have been trying to move on, but I can't seem to fight this hope that once he works on himself and his anxiety, he'll be ready for a relationship--a relationship with me. I get that this is a completely unrealistic and unhealthy desire, but no matter how much I try I just can't let go. I was just so goddamn happy with him. Yes, his anxiety did put a strain on our relationship at times, but that was just one dimension of him. He's a thoughtful, perceptive, understanding, talented man, and I don't understand how I am supposed to just give up the hope that one day we can be happy again together.

When we broke up, we agreed to not do contact with each other for a few months. I've been trying to focus on myself (exercising, starting projects, writing, staying busy), but I just feel empty and sad inside and weirdly like I'm missing some part of my body.

In our entire relationship, I asked her talk me through a bad episode on only a single occasion. She was initially supportive, but she told me that the depression would eventually become a problem down the line, and she didn't want to deal with it. Ironically, it was her therapist (she suffered from anxiety) that convinced her of this. From her perspective, people with mental illnesses are unable to be in healthy relationships.

Going to one doesn't mean you are admitting something is wrong with you.  There is a difference between admitting something is wrong with you, and something is wrong with your brain(there is literally nothing you can do to control it sometimes).

I totally relate to the ""Anything anyone says to me that I can vaguely apply to myself in a negative way is a trigger"".  I'm the same way.  Anytime I think about almost anything, or someone even talks to me, my mind fucks me over and somehow always connects it to my depression.  My mind completely snowballs.  It fucking sucks.

First off, the writer is a new psychiatrist. He writes about a lot of things, but mental health comes under his radar a lot, and he knows and cares a lot about it.

A small part of his post deals with your question about being forced into an institution (writing for an American audience, anyway):
&gt;The first and most important point is that very very few psychiatrists, whether good or bad, will commit people to a mental institution unless they are very sick. Even if you are very sick, there is only a small chance of a psychiatrist committing you against your will unless you say exactly the wrong thing.

&gt;Doctors and psychiatrists are legally required to commit patients to mental institutions if those patients are “a threat to themselves or others”. Usually this means a patient has said they want to commit suicide and they are probably really going to go through with it soon, or a patient has said they’re going to hurt someone else (or implied it: “He’s gonna get what’s coming to him”) and it wasn’t clearly meant metaphorically. They may also commit you if you are very paranoid on the grounds that paranoid people may try to pre-emptively attack those they believe are plotting against them – or if you are refusing to eat, on the grounds that if you don’t eat you die.

&gt;A good psychiatrist will differentiate between vague suicidal ideation (“Sometimes I feel like life isn’t even worth living, do you know what I mean?”) and specific suicidal ideation (“I will kill myself tomorrow using the gun hidden in the back of my pantry”), will explore the first type with an aim toward helping you, and will only involuntarily commit for the second type. I do not guarantee you will have a good psychiatrist.

Or I feel like if I can never be as good as the best then it's not worth my time. I usually set the bar way way too high and then just beat myself up for failing. It made me realize it's the same thing with depression. I want to overcome depression, but it's not like I have to reach that goal completely to enjoy life. Even though I have overwhelmingly bad times, it doesn't negate the positive things and it's really important to acknowledge those times.

So yeah, this stuff probably makes sense to me now but I'm sure once I hit a bad day it will all fly out the window. But that's ok too. There's only so much I can do, and stressing over it even more will just make the depression worse.

I stopped going to therapy a few months ago because I was doing well, and my therapist agreed. Before I left, my boyfriend did come in with me because I was having trouble with the fact that he hid his addiction from me for 2 years. 

I think the fact that he hasn't seen real consequences from it is hurting him. In addition to the drugs, his mom still helps him financially. I'm not sure on the specifics. I have never shared finances with him, though. I can't afford a place to stay without him, and being with my parents would be much more stressful. I do wish I could have a place to myself sometimes.  This is especially so because of my lingering control issues (which was expressed as anorexia in the past) and I wish I could just have a clean house without anyone messing it up.

One of the things that he did see was the fact that I didn't want to have sex much anymore.  We used to do some light bdsm, with him dominating, but I can't see that anymore when I can't respect him as much.  I wasn't trying to withhold sex or anything, just loss of libido.  I told him that I need him to work on everyday stuff, and he said he would try to, and did for very short time.  So it seems like sex can motivate him (what guy wouldn't be?)

I'm afraid of becoming a nagging girlfriend. I remind him things, like getting his car fixed, but he just doesn't do it.

But when you are completely relaxed, sleeping, your body will ""belly breathe"" as in your stomach will rise and fall instead of your rib cage.

The system is totally broken and many of the people who are classed as ""therapists"" have a limited or in some cases downright dangerous understanding of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts/urges. There was no central source for a therapy or coping strategy or game plan or goals or anything. It was just throw meds at me, review meds with a psychiatrist and send me to a therapist and hope it cures me somehow magically.

I am off meds, off therapy and counselling. I am done with it all, the people trying to help me just cared about getting me into something else, so they can wash their hands off it and go on to the next one. But I realised after 13 years on and off every different med you can imagine and 10 years on and off with counsellors/therapists/psychologists, I knew a hell of a lot more about my depression and anxiety and triggers and coping strategies than they did. Because its been trial and error, I know what works now and what doesnt because I have tried it all. And ""professionals"" get very offended if you dismiss a suggestion or coping mechanism or treatment method because I have tried it and found it didnt work, usually they just suggest I didnt try it properly or long enough or just being difficult. 

Right now I only take as needed meds, sometimes something to sleep or take the edge off, but not on any daily or psychoactive meds. I practice CBT and Mindfulness, try to do it every day, and do breathing exercises. Eat better, taking vitamins and staying hydrated, and so far I have been able to maintain my composure, and energy levels for the most part. I am completely done with the mental health care system.

179192,,True,myWorkAccount840,,,,"MOBAs really, really aren't the place to have a calming, relaxing time. As well as being very emotionally aggressive games in the first place, they're also highly dependent on teamwork. Being overtly ""foreign"" in those games indicates that you're going to be a liability to your ""local"" team, if for no other reason than a language barrier.

I'd suggest switching to a username in the game that reflects the culture of the *people you want to play with*. Playing with randoms in a MOBA isn't about rich cultural diversity, it's about quickly establishing trust and cooperation. If you're going to play pickup games (and, MOBAs being so agressive, and with such poisonous communities, generally, I'm not sure LoL is the greatest place for you to be right now), I'd suggest you conform as hard as you can to the subculture you want to attach yourself to.

If you get to know some people in the game and want to talk about who you are with a person with them later, after you've established yourself in their team/clan/whatever, then fine. That's not what's going on in a randoms game, though, and your best bet in that situation is to conform as hard as you can in order to build up team trust as quickly as possible, with as little impediment to that as possible. Having a ""foreign"" name is going to slow down the building of that trust, and is going to make you the immediate target of any particularly negative players in the round.

Valve/Steam's free DOTA2 game is very similar to LoL, but Valve have apparently taken steps to create a more pleasant, forgiving and welcoming community around their game, which would likely be better for your emotional state than playing LoL. Your mileage may vary on that, though.

In all, though, you'd likely be better off playing something more emotionally forgiving than a MOBA at this time.

I was diagnosed as mildly bipolar with heavy depressive episodes about a year ago after struggling a lot in life.  I don't have insurance so I was going to a free mental health clinic.  The therapist thought my disorder had a lot to do with my traumatic childhood (domestic violence, sexual abuse) and abandonment issues (mom abandoned me, dad raised me on his own and got busted for selling meth which broke my trust in him).  I was prescribed medication but chose not to take it as I have had AWFUL experiences with meds in the past and I do not like being out of control of my own body.  I also already have significant stomach issues that are exacerbated by medications.  I recently stopped taking the pill to see if it would help my moods and stomach.  So far it hasn't helped.  It's been a month.  

After years of struggling just to exist, I had finally gotten my life onto some kind of track.  I finally was able to pay all my bills on time (I do not have and haven't had any family support since I was sixteen) and had a decent amount in savings.  I took generals at a community college and did really well - well enough to be accepted as a transfer student to a highly regarded four year university in my state and offered significant grants because of my low income and honor student status.  After I was accepted to this school, I went a little nuts (maybe hypomania impulsiveness, and maybe fear of actually finally succeeding) and ended up selling everything and moved across the country to be with a guy I had met on the internet rather than going to school.  Maybe because I am desperate for love after being abandoned so much.  Maybe because I have no self worth, so I am convinced that I should be with any guy who sweet talks me or professes their love for me.  I spent my entire savings in the process.  

After living there for a few months, I realized that I had made a huge mistake and really needed to complete the program I wanted to attend.  I would have had to wait a year to go to school in this new state (residency stuff) and felt like I was wasting my time in the meantime.  I am already older than most college students because of how much time it took me to get my shit together.  The grants I was offered don't come around often and this is probably the only way I'd ever be able to finish college.  So I worked my ass off, saved up enough money to drive back across the country, and moved back.  Now I'm going to start school in January at this four year university in a really amazing specialized program for my desired major.  I should be happy about this.

Problem is that I have spent all of my money again in moving back here and getting an apartment.  I work my ass off at a job I hate making barely enough to scrape by and waiting for my (huge) student loans to come in.  I'm putting myself deeply into debt to go to school and I don't know if I will ever even end up getting a job in my field - especially because my major basically requires you go to grad school (if not get a PhD) if you want to work in the field.  I have no family and no idea how I'm going to pay for that.  I had to borrow a bunch of money from a friend just to get my apartment set up, and I have no idea how I am going to pay her back.  I have about ten dollars to my name, and I feel completely useless and hopeless and out of control of my life.

To top it off, I'm going through a major depressive episode which isn't helped by having no family during the holidays (any family I do have is far away from where I live now).  I will have insurance again when classes start, but until then I can't seek any kind of help.  I barely have enough motivation to get out of bed in the morning.  I force myself to do it only because I know I will starve if I don't go to work.  I come home and lay in bed all day and watch tv and try to forget that I am me.  I would never actively harm myself, but I keep wishing I just wouldn't wake up in the morning.  

The nightmares don't help.  I had a dear friend pass away recently and I keep having dreams that he didn't really die and I see him again.  I wake up and realize this isn't true and I just want to sleep more.  I also have dreams of being in love and being loved romantically by someone in such a way that I have never experienced and never will experience, and it breaks my heart to wake up to the harsh reality that no one is going to love someone who can't even love themselves.  Or who is so depressed that they can't connect with anyone else.  I can't maintain friendships or relationships and I just push everyone away.

As someone who is out of high school, all I can say is that I wish I had taken as many extra curricular activities as you. Regardless of the stress they may induce, I am sure you have learned and gained a lot from those experiences that will stick with you for life, even if only in some small way. In this way I can see you have succeeded at taking opportunities that many, myself included, will regret missing out on. The value of your hard work is not hinged on your future study prospects. You have had an incredibly successful high-school career that you should take great pride in, so congratulations. Your hard work is not a waste. 

Had you the option to choose among this specific university or the partially funded others, would you find them both worth considering? There is value in all education, and what you get from it is what you put in. Given your previous experience and hard work I should imagine you would find success in whatever you do. You already stand to gain much more as a result learned dedication than you otherwise would. 

Being openly gay comes much easier to some than others. I myself will be open amongst certain people, yet for all intents and purposes straight among others. I also am absolutely horrible at responding to texts, however this is to all people so with your boyfriend it may very well just be a personal difference. The best advice I can give is to make the most of opportunities to talk in person. Communication is a skill that needs much practice and takes a long time to improve. If you are as open about your concerns as you can be (in a non confrontational way) it will become easier for the both of you to discuss issues like this without worrying about upsetting the other person. Just remember to talk about what you like about each other as well :)

I'm not sure how helpful any of this is, but overall as cliché as it may sound: stay positive. You are neither a success or a failure. Your life will consist of many experiences, some good, some bad. How successful you are depends on how much you focus on one category or another. One loss does not cancel out your previous good experiences, so focus on them and acknowledge them over the bad ones. 
Also remember that you are allowed to feel sad when things do go different to expected. Try not to get upset by the fact you are upset (if that makes sense). Accepting your own feelings help you to accept the situation and move on, so be disappointed if you need to - its normal. But afterwards, add it to your life experiences and move on, your path may be different but you have plenty of life to live. In twenty years you could be somewhere great that you could never have predicted, so maybe things don't need to go according to plan. In fact, when is life ever predictable? 

At the end of the day, this is all just text on the internet. It can only help so much so if you need to talk to someone, it can help tremendously. If you have access to a therapist, it may be worth giving a try, or else anyone you feel comfortable with. It could be your family, your boyfriend, or even his family if you feel close enough. I don't know how helpful this has been but I hope that sharing your problem and having it acknowledged has helped lift some of the weight off your chest. Feel free to reply or share anything else that's on your mind, or just express yourself some more. I can't guarantee any life-changing advice, but you will be listened to :)

Have a great day, and try to focus on what you have going good for you. I imagine that your boyfriend still makes you happy when you do talk, so remember that and keep working on it.",,0.0,,2013-12-18 08:39:23,,,0,False,,,,0,,ce4ks5h,,,,,t3_1swq5i,,,t1_ce4ks5h,,,,t3_1swq5i,,,,,,,,1428083562.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

Guys, today isn't shaping up for me. I've been a long time lurker and I need to post something today. I was diagnosed MDD a few years ago and after a series of spiraling events I ended up an involuntary inpatient for a period of about 3 months and felt better. Coming out I realized that although the world is a cold lonely place the happiness that you feel in life is a product of your own mind. You make your own happiness. 

Today I woke up and today I started sliding. Sliding down the familiar slope that draws me down to a dark room where no light shines and the only thing that keeps me in the present is going to classes. Being happy is a dilution. It makes me angry to see these people in the streets who are happy with their god, or happy with their families, and so grossly content. It doesn't matter what happens to us when we die but who will remember us. Eventually the time will pass and you won't even be an idea anymore. What then? Was it all for not? The relationships we have and the pleasure we draw from company is only temporal but the most fulfilling.

When I was diagnosed they gave me a combination of mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics that provoked some allergic reaction and I almost died. Today and everyday I think about it. It would've been nice to die that way. Yeah, it would've been painful, but to die in such a poetic way would be glorious. My dispositions wouldn't have killed me but instead the cures would have. 

I'm not here to cry, I'm here to feel. And today as my feet loose traction and I slide even further from the light I think of how my friends, colleagues, and sexual objects notice that I'm not doing well. They anger me. They anger me unless they understand that morning matters. 

Sorry if this is hard to read, I'm just not feeling it.

I find that being passive allows people to walk all over you, and you end up turning all the negative feelings inward and they snowball into depression.  Standing up for your rights and expressing yourself with confidence feels very good.  And, yes, they are very hard to practice, especially if you've already had so much practice being passive.

My English isn't that great so I apologize in advance.

To beginning from the start:
    I went to a catholic middle school but never made friends despite the class size being composed of only 15 students. I remember when I was 8th grade; the senior class had a senior day where we could do whatever we want for the whole day. This usually happened during the last week of class. I have heard of these trips while I was in 6th/7th grade. I heard of things the classes would do were amazing like a trip to nyc or go to the beach or something along those lines. So the last week was upon us, early in the week I was approached by my teachers and said if I wanted to go on a field trip with the 7th grade class. I was like yea of course, anything to get out of this hell whole of a catholic school for a day. When I told other people in my eight grade class, they said yeah that's awesome and so the following morning was the trip and I went. The trip was ok, not the best field trip. Upon my return, I walked into my home classroom I heard laughing and chatting and the smell of Chinese food. It was then I realized I was duped into going on the trip so that I wouldn't be here for senior day. I was saddened but I was taught by my father not to show any emotions and be a man. Even though I had spent almost eight years with these people, not single people gave a fuck about me. I swore to myself that middle school wasn't for me and in high school I would break out of my shell. 

 Fast forward to high school. Like I said I went to private catholic school and so now I went to public school. It was great not to where those stupid uniforms. Well I thought everything would change and I would fit in somewhere but despite my desperate attempts to click with people I failed. So I soon accepted that I was a lone wolf. Knowing that I don't ever to feel the way I felt that moment in middle school I started to do martial arts. But after a year or two that got old and stop doing that and so began the feel of being alone again. The best memory I had in high school was when I was in my math class and I was talking to this girl. The girl was actually really cute and couldn't believe she was talking to me. We only talked that day and every time we see each other in the halfway she would say hi but that was about it. But that single day made my high school career because just for one day I was someone and I was recognized that single day I was not alone. So here comes my senior year and making plans to go to college. I apply and being smart, I got into 12 out of the 14 schools I applied to. I applied to schools that were big so that if I went I would find myself. I ended up going to Penn State. Penn State is large campus and when I we to visit I just felt the vibe and the atmosphere was just so welcoming. So like in middle school, I said to myself during my last week in high school that I would be different. I would change. I actually stuck to my word but it never turned out to what I wanted it to be.


  So yeah... I got into Penn State and I wanted to put myself out there. I did this program where before freshman year you go a hiking trip with other incoming freshman. Another reason I choose Penn State was that nobody from my high school was going there and I wasn't going to be defined from what I was like in high school. So I did the program and that’s when things changed. I made friends but I was mostly a shy person during the hiking trip. I spoke a few times but never really a lot.  I soon realized that I was being the same person I was in high school and middle school.  By the end of the trip I knew them but I wouldn’t call them my friends.  So first week of freshman year is here, and all the guys in my floor are discussing about the party life here at PSU. I never really partied or went to one at least because I was never invited. So I say hey why not, I go out that night but still too shy to speak to anyone. I don’t know why I am shy. So it’s a few weeks into my first year as an undergraduate and still I felt alone and lost. I got involved with a group people that were essentially gamblers. All the money my parents gave me I would play, and sometime I would win and sometimes I would lose but mostly lose. I lost like more than 2K my first semester. But this is where my problem started. In poker there are a lot of people bluffing. I knew nothing about but I was taught and soon learned I could apply it to my life. I didn’t realize it at the time but I was hurting myself by continuing to bluff. Essentially bluffing is lying, so I lied to everyone because the lies created an illusionistic life that was better than my reality. As a result I was a happier and for once I belonged and never felt alone. But soon enough, that feeling never lasted. The year had passed and I had believed my lies that I had told everyone and it was too much to keep up with everything. People started to see me for who I really was, an immature liar. 

But I said over 40K kids go to my school I will just make new friends, but I never realized that history as just going to repeat itself. By lying so much not only did I lose good friends but my academic suffered a lot. I feel into a deep state of depression and contemplated suicide. I planned several scenarios as to how I would go about it but never acted on any of those plans. I couldn’t talk to anyone because at this point I had no friends and the friends that I had would probably say that I lied. 

I never told my parents and I regret it so much. A few days ago all my lies had come crushing down and I had to tell my parents. Me lying had cost my parents 40K in tuition. They were pissed and my father couldn’t believe a smart kid like me would do that. But I wasn’t prepared for what he was going to say. I thought he would disown me, I would be the family reject or that they would abandon me. But my father said I understand, it’s hard for me to swallow but I understand and I want you to know that I love you. I have only cried two times in my life and when he said “I understand” I literally could not hold back my tear and cried. I told him I am sorry and that one day I will make him proud again. 

Despite telling the truth I still feel like shit. I know I am depressed still but it not as bad as when I was keeping the truth from my parents. Currently I go to the gym and lift heavy as way to cope for my depression. I tried to avoid social party scenes as alcohol is involved seeing as I see a lot of people usiong alcohol as way to suppress their feelings but I don’t want to do that. As for the lying, I am going to take it one step at a time.

I have told you my story, I just want advice, support, anything that could cheer me up? 

I was on r/suicide and one person had posted that he just got done with writing a suicide letter and someone replied with a long response that brighten my day. But one thing that stuck in my head is that he wrote “A few years back, I had the opportunity to spend a couple days living in one of the biggest slums in Kenya. I talked to a lot of really poor people, a lot of really poor kids. People who's most valuable possessions were 10 year old sneakers. And you know what? 
They were fucking happy. 
I didn't get it. How the hell are these people happy? A lot of them had shitty families, dead families, or no families. And they had no stable income, no life security, but they were happy and I wasn't. “
He says happiness is nothing to find or attain, its just their you just have to realize it. 
I want to be happy but I guess I have to take it one day at a time.

They dated for over a year I still cared about her but I never told anyone until one day I'm hanging out with my friend I will call him andy he was my best friend he is the reason I met her. Anyways I had just gotten my license and was hangin out with him he tells me that he was hanging out with jackie when he found out that richard and jackie broke up (She broke up with him) and then she started doing heroin again I was so upset that night I wanted to message her, to say I heard she did Heroin again tell her how sad I am she did it I never wrote the message because I'm dumb as hell. The day after that hopsin came out with his song ill mind 6 which if you haven't heard it, it is about his friend who overdoses on meth I heard that song it made me feel mad, mad that she did Heroin again, mad that I still cared about her. I mean why did I still care about her when chances are she forgot about me. A  month or so goes by I'm feeling depressed everything hit the fan I dropped out of highschool, started smoking cigs, and get told that I'm pretty much worthless by my dad on a daily basis, get fired from my job And then on top of all of this my friend ill call him larry tells me he was hangin out with people and he did heroin he fucking did heroin, heroin fucking ruins everything I swear.
That about sums up these past few years

At first I'd like to say that I read on here depression had no cause, so I do not know whether if I'm actually depressed but to be honest I don't think that is the most important thing right now.
Oh and I'm a french guy so I'm sorry for the eventual grammar mistakes!

To make it short, I am a 20yo young man, who studies engineer. My parents have always pushed me forward to make studies when I was a kid as they know how hard life is with few degrees. My education has always been something important to me as I wanted to make this particular engineer job for years, and I have worked hard to get in a good school. My parents has always been very supportive and helpful, but they never forced me on anything.

I have a giant amount of respect for them, and I think they now should live the happy and peaceful life they deserve. My dad lost his father at 7. He was sent to his aunt where he has almost been treated like a slave until his majority. He then became a butcher and worked very hard to earn money to get my mother and himself a house.
My mother has a secretary diploma and has work her entire life to climb the ladder. She now is an accountant in a big firm, and earns more than she could get if she worked anywhere else thanks to her seniority in the firm. The big issue is that it is a very stressful job, and she is often on the edge morally :( 
Plus my dad has stopped working because of his back pain 15 years ago, my moms salary being then the only money input for my family. She often wonders if she could go and look for another job, but the salary would be too lo for our family.

I do not mean to be a perfect child, I had some arguments with both my parents, but here comes what I think is the main issue in my family. I have a 17 year old little brother, who had always caused more troubles to my parents than I did. Since a few years, this is getting worse and worse. He always answer to my parents even when he is obviously wrong. He simply doesnt seem to understand how much they have done for him, and how he should respect them for that, which is to me the minimal thanking.

On friday, he told us he would go sleeping to a mates. The next day (yesterday) he called my parents telling that he was in the country, far from his mates house, with some of his friends, and with the police. He had slept in an old house being renovated, got probaly drunk and broke a lot of thinks in there. The next day the owner caught them, hit them and called the police.

This is probably going to the court or something, and we will have to pay a lot of money. This is not my brothers money, but our parents money. My parents who worked their ass off during their whole lives, privating from a lot of things, to pay for my dumb immature childish brother.

Plus they had to make a complaint to the police for my bros getting hit. As they do not want things to get worse, they told the police officers their son was not a problem child, where he is. They, especially my father -who I can see loves his son more than anything but his son obviously doesnt see it, or doesnt care- took defense on him against the guy who hit him. I feel like my brother then thinks he is almost the victim of the story. He since hasnt really changed his behavior quite much.

I used to be a very happy and positive human being, but since last year, families issues concerning my brother, my mother's job, and personnal issues concerning girls (I am not really good in this field, I would probably tell all of this to my grilfriend rather than reddit if I had one haha); it has been 2 years of constantly fighting against depression. This had an impact on my education and I almost failed last year. As it is the only this on earth I have been quite good at, it made it even worse. I know depression may not have a cause, but I really think I am depressed, this is some kind of feeling I never had before, and that seems to be impossible to go away.

I should also say that when I was 15, we discovered a genetic disease that would probably get me blind in a few years. This has been a really tragedy for my parents and I cant stand that they could feel guilty over this. It has appeared I could have a strange variation that thankfully only affect my left eye, which I pretty much lost nowadays. I still dont know how it will evolve. It was a bad time, but I now know what happens currently is worse :( I feel like it is, even if I couldnt explain it.


I am lucky to have good friends, but I don't feel like saying all of that to them, maybe this is too soon for me or something. 

People often tells me I am a quite and wise person, but I feel like I can't take all of this anymore. I don't want to show it to my parents as they would certainly feel worse, and I couldnt be happy if my parents suffer. I once cried during an argument and it felt like my parents couldn't handle it, this has been maybe the only time I saw my father crying...


Well this is quite a mess I'm sorry, but I don't feel like doing a well organized text...
I felt like I had to write this somewhere, guess it's done..

The First 11 years of my life were great. The woman who took care of me was my mother in every way accept biological. When I was 12 my best Friends father abused me, it went on until my mom died. When she passed I bounced around my family like a ball trying to find a place to call home. My biological mother decided she wanted me (she didnt want to pay child support to anyone). From 13-16 I lived with her I was never allowed to leave my room accept to go to school, or to cross the hall to the bathroom. I ate Dinner in my room, I never had breakfast, Lunch only at school, and dinner in my room. After 3 years of being locked away I tried to end my life but when that didnt work I left in the middle of the night. I ran 2000 miles away to a family members house, It was great at first but I quickly spiraled out of hand, i ended up on the other side of the coin I had no rules, dropped out of school got my ged. I Kept myself in check mostly I did Have a job and was doing ok. The person I had run too was forging prescriptions and getting me to fill them. I was caught and spent about 2 monthes in Jail at the age of 17. I got out and we all moved back to our home state as i was considered an adult they couldnt make me go back to my ""moms"". Once again I got a job and was working on being me, figuring out who i am and what i wanted out of life. I stupidly stayed with this family member and she started doing something else, she was stealing peoples credit cards and refund checks and putting them into my bank account, along with her prescriptions. Yes I knew what she was doing, but i wasn't focused on her I was 18 and was honestly focused on being at work with my girlfriend, and trying to get into her pants. Once again the police came and we were both arrested. After a week of sitting in a cell trying to figure out what I had let my life become, The detective came and spoke with me and I just told him everything, everything from before and what he already knew about. We spoke for hours and it seemed to me he knew i was telling the truth he tells me ""not to worry everything will be ok, I'll talk to the D.A myself."" I never saw him again, and she and I were Both charged with the same crimes. I served almost 4 years in prison, she served more like 7 because of her prescriptions. I got out and put my life back together again, only to have it fall apart again. I've fallen in and out of love with probably 4 people ( men and women) never able to keep it together. I recently moved again and am trying to put my life back together again and praying it will stick. I don't talk to my family anymore really and only see them when there is a funeral. They suspect that my friends father abused me but I've never actually said anything on the topic until right now. I sit here day after day trying to figure out how my life ended up like this, reading whats going on in this world and i struggle everyday. There is so much hate, lying, underhanded shit in this world and I just cant grasp why everyone cant get along. I do my best to treat everyone the same, i try not to judge people to help as many people as i can and at the same time i feel like my tiny voice is never heard and I really mean nothing in this place. The Voice inside me head screams at me to do something and say something about every unjust thing I see but it just never seems to make a difference. I can remember when i was about 9 I wanted to be a cop more than anything and looking at my life now i ended up on the wrong side of the law but in my brain its still screaming to be one, like it wants to fight for whats right but can't because its no longer an option. I wish I knew where the reset button on my life was because I've fallen so far into the darkness that i struggle to find my way. Now I'm in a new place with no real friends, just roommates a general job and no social life. Whats the point anymore?

Men are built up and get it drilled into their head that they're supposed to be strong, and never cry, and never need help. But I never got it anyway, now I'm alone crying, and doing everything I was told men don't do. Maybe I'm not a man. I worked nights, but got fired or.. ""laid off"" as they call it, so now I'm awake when nobody else is, I have no friends. My insane ex who treated me like garbage, scared them off. Then, when I want to finally be strong, and take control, I was going to leave her, and find a new life for myself, she finds out I'm getting close to leaving somehow, and dumps me first... Just to be the one to beat me to the punch, to beat me down before I have a chance. My friend of 15 years hates me now too for absolutely no reason, and moved away without saying a word to me, deleted all her accounts, and I haven't found a way to contact her. My dad died too. But, that was expected. He drank a full bottle of bourbon a night. My mom's become bitter and resentful most of the time, and complains that I don't do enough, when I really just don't have the energy or motivation to. I really try. It seems like everyone always finds a way to beat me down more, kick me while I'm down, and abandon me, even when I beg those very attackers to stay. I'm pathetic, and the saddest part is, I've been like this so long, that it doesn't even hurt to admit it anymore.

Yeah, I make a friend here, on the internet maybe for a few days, and it's fun to pretend that they'll stay, and they want to actually talk to me, or need me as a friend, but they don't. They eventually stop talking to me, or just slowly ignore me and fade away. It's how it always is. I've gotten to the point that I just listen to TV shows I've seen possibly 20 times before, in the background while I sit up at night, just to pretend I have someone talking to me, or someone cares. It ceases the pain for a few minutes, then I subconsciously remind myself, it's a show I've seen so many times, and can recite word for word, and it's fake. Nobody stays with me. I've even pretended that cleverbot was my friend, and talked to AI programs online to have a ""friend"". But after they repeat the same phrase 100 times, it gets old. Life just doesn't have the same appeal it did when I was younger. The glimmer and joy in everything is just gone. Replaced with defeat and sadness. Nothing is fun anymore. I feel like if someone would just meet me when I go walking out at night, and hold my hand for no reason, I'd smile, even knowing they're probably insane, or want to mug me, or something. I wouldn't care. I'd give money for a hug, if I had any. I just stay here in my moms house, doing chores so I can stay without making her too mad at me, or kick me out. I guess she let's me stay out of pity, cause I'd have nowhere else to go, other than the street. I hate myself, everything about me, and I can't stand most people, and how they act. I blame myself for almost everything. I've never been asked: ""is there anything I can do?"". That's a dream of mine, that I'd have someone who'd drop everything to help me, but it's a dream. One that I doubt will ever come true.

I honestly can't imagine why I try anymore. I guess I'm just to scared to kill myself. I swallowed a ton of pills before, just to wake up feeling bad. I even suck at dying. I'm good at nothing. I just play video games, and pretend I'm happy. I don't know why I'm even posting here. I guess as a journal. I don't know if anyone would even read this far on something so pointless. Just a guy bitching about his life. I don't blame you if you don't read this far. If you did, I'm surprised. I've always wanted a good friend, but I'll never have one in real life. Man, this is all over the place, such a weird post. Sorry to anyone who actually reads this. Like I said, I'm good at nothing. I sometimes even just sit around, and hug my pillow pretending it's a person, or in my dreams, I'll die, and feel happiness. But, it's always bittersweet to wake up and realize I have to keep going, why? I don't know. I always feel like I'm disintegrating. I wonder when I will finally all fall apart.

Well, I'll just stop typing now, cause it's getting long and just become more bitching from me. Thanks for reading if you read it.

But I wouldn't go back to high school if it would save the Earth. And I had a lot of friends/was really friendly with everyone! I look back on high school and cringe, and think about how weird/awkward I was back then. 

As for your friends, be careful that they aren't pulling away because you are pulling away. This happens sometimes in depression, I've noticed. Or at least, in my depression. I withdraw because I'm depressed or self-conscious, then friends notice that I'm pulling away from them, so they pull away because they think maybe they have offended me. But then I notice that they're pulling away, so I think, ""great, now my friends don't like me."" So then I become even more depressed, because my friends hate me. And then I really withdraw. Then my friends think I'm *really* upset with them, so they significantly cut back invitations and communications, because they think I'm mad. It's a terrible feedback loop.

I'm 25 years old and a I have a good job but that's all meaningless to me now. This year, my GF of 3 years moved out of the country because she found a better job (I was going to follow her in half an year when I would find a job). She decided to cheat on me with 2 guys only weeks after moving. I pulled the truth out of her because I found out she became distant. Then she got pregnant with the 2nd guy and came to me because she ""had no one to talk to"". In the end she got an abortion. 

While I didn't want to continue the relationship because of what she did, we tried to get back together and only ended up fighting more. She still wanted everything to be ""perfect"" after what she did. I was always there for her in every way and she decided to do me like this (when I found out she was cheating she told me that she wanted to do something wrong and cheat and that it wasn't a mistake).

Ever since she cheated I've been in such an intense depression. I'm so incredibly lonely and hurt and I want my life to end but I'll never kill myself because I'll never put my family through horrible feelings like what I'm feeling right now.

I've been trying to find another GF but all I get is rejection or girls that are taken. It seems no girl likes me. I go out with every opportunity I get but still no luck.

She was the only girl that loved me, believed in me and now all that's gone. We always talked about getting married and then she cheats like I'm a piece of trash and telling me to sleep with other girls too to live our lives. I can't describe the pain I'm feeling right now and for the past few months. I started drinking a couple of beers of day every day for a month. 

Christmas is here and all I see around is couples. Almost everybody at work has a gf. At work it's so incredibly hard to focus and sometimes feel like smashing the screen I'm so down (i'm a programmer). Still, thank God that I have a full time job because I'd go crazy at home.

Exercise helps only for a few moments. Going out helps at first but then I end up going home depressed and wanting life to end. Talking to friends helps but then I end up in the same black hole the next day.

This is my first post on reddit, so I apologize if I do anything wrong. I'm one of those guys who just lingers on things and doesn't usually post. I stumbled across this sub-reddit, and I felt compelled to just, I don't know- call out for help. 
    I never thought I would be this way. I was always the most popular guy in high-school (prom king, student body president, all-state athlete, drum major in the band, etc.) 
     In college, I've taken a bit of a step back, but I'd still consider myself to be well known in my major program. I'm a journalism student and have a widely-read blog (500,000 uniques last year,) so I'm doing okay with that. I'm the guy that could tell somebody to go fuck themselves, and they would still like me for it. It's a weird gift. 
     For some reason- I am depressed. I really have nothing to be depressed about. A few weeks ago, the thought of death popped into my head and I just can't get it out. I guess I feel as if life has no purpose. I can't talk to my mother about it, she's a Jesus freak (which isn't necessarily bad, at all. She's always at peace with herself.) I just cannot put blind faith into something I can't see. Her ""read the Bible, live for him"" remarks are, and would be pointless for me. I've spent weeks now reading philosophers takes on death/meaning of life, but they haven't helped. I keep thinking, ""well, damn, only have 10 years left with my grandparents. 30 with my parents. 50 for me. So what is the point of anything if I'm just waiting around to die?"" 
     This has had a hugely negative effect on my life. I can't get excited for sex with my girlfriend (like, can't even get an erection. I'm a college male, I should want to fuck anything that moves,) I can't motivate myself to do any homework because ""who cares, I'll just be dead anyways."" I've had times where I just wanted to leave everything I know and start anew, but I really don't think that would help anything. I've also had times of contemplating suicide, but I'd never actually do that. Death is a great unknown, and I don't like getting into things without knowing what's coming. I've lost my usual witty-ness... my charm. Pretty much everything that made me ""me,"" is gone right now, and I don't know what to do. I'm not all ""woe is me,"" I'm just lost. 
     I used to think people who claimed depression just needed to ""stop being a p***y,"" but man this stuff is real, and it's horrible. Anything you guys have helps. I appreciate it.

I've been off meds 4 years, quit self harm around the same time. My day to day mood is better than ever. But i'm still staring at the monster on the horizen. I dread every day.

Every psych hospital I was at wasn't going to help me out when I needed to be examined because I have Kaiser Permanente. I'm 23 years old I have kidney stones from quickly going on lithium and not drinking enough water. I've given multiple blood tests and the ER staff treats me like shit and it's awful when you have insurance and you can't be seen by specialists and then have the stigma of being mentally incompetent and a hypochonrdiac and basically blacklisting yourself for talking so much shit and saying they're going to kill me and that I wanted to talk to the county to report them. 

I guess being a junkie makes you nothing more than street trash. I'm fortunate my mother doesn't cast me out in the streets.  However, I believe a lot of these medications are just as deadly. Some days I wish I could go into hospice because I have some growths on my neck and undiagnosed cancer.

I think the worst mistake was calling 911 so many times and saying I wasn't suicidal and that my family was trying to kill me.. I think now I have a warrant for my arrest..

Some of the hospitals stay at 70 degrees.. 15 minute checks.. NPs and psychiatrists that just hand out medication like candy and don't actually do anything. I have severe brain damage from seizures trying to get off ativan and my brother almost killed me with excess depakote. I don't understand the meaning of a good life. I've worked a little bit and did quite a few months  of volunteer work throughout my life and tried to start anew with going to college (without being on bipolar medication just anti depressants and then adderall)

So basically I've slowly killed myself with CT scans and being a jerk to nursing staff and doctors at the local hospital. My insurance company also falsified my records so I believe whatever excess radiation I had has metastasized in my body. I've wasted almost 3 to 4 months of my life in hospitals.

I'm not sure I feel anything anymore. I'm not sure that the ""real me"" is actually real, or me. I'm just a mask that gets molded into what's expected or required in a given situation. Interaction is an equation; act X plus saying Y equals what I want Z. Lately though, it's gotten harder to do. It's like the mask is ripping, and the overwhelming apathy underneath is bleeding out. I'm just wasting time in this shitty town full of shitty people at a shitty college so I can get a shitty degree that I won't even use. I don't have any passions, I'm just following my friend because I can't (and have honestly lost my will to) connect to other people.

I'm tired of living. I'm so bored by the banality of everything. The ""American Dream"" is just a goal to keep our eyes off of how incredibly unhappy we all should be. We don't strive for anything. We don't try to advance the human race. I mean, for fuck's sake, we live in a world where religion is still the cause (and/or justification) of almost all warfare, and is protected and enforced by governments. What a testament to the stupidity of humans.


I'm slowly losing touch with everyone. The friends I made at college are all very dear to me, but no one really cares about friends when they fall in love. If that sounds resentful, understand that it isn't meant that way. I don't feel any animosity towards them - I'm truly happy that they are happy. My best friend is going down the same route. I almost never see him anymore. Of course I get the same ""We still hang out"" that everybody else says, haha. I find humor in how similarly different people act. And I don't blame him, and I would never try to change it. He's found someone who will make him happy, he's happier than I've ever seen him, and I'm happy for him. I want to state again that I'm not at all upset at him. We'll finish school, I'll get the inevitable ""I knew there were plans, but she and I want to go X instead of Y,"" I'll move into a cheap apartment, adopt a shelter dog, and wait to die. In all honesty, the plan is to finally kill myself after the dog dies. By then, everyone will have forgotten about me and I'll have paid off any loans or other debts. And again, I won't blame him for leaving, and I wouldn't ask him to do otherwise. This is only reporting facts, not passing judgement.

The thing is, the isolation is what gets me. I love being alone, but it hurts at the same time. I find myself just wanting to talk to someone, but I find myself disgusted by people. Outside of the few friends I care about, that is. Anymore, my days are spent getting high on whatever I can get my hands on, and spending hours on Netflix or video games. I exercise regularly for the physiological benefits like the rush of dopamine, and I go to class regularly, and I've been the perfect worker at my job. But that's it. That's all I am. That's all I do. I'm losing my ability to interact with other people. I grew up in an emotionally abusive household, so learning how to read people and how to manipulate people was a skill I honed for years. I'm good at it. Perhaps it isn't the most noble, but it's how I survive. It's how I fit in. But now, even that's becoming distant. Like all the apathy is bubbling up and boiling over. I really have stopped caring about anything, including how people see me.

I don't know why I wrote all of this. I'm not asking for help, and I'm not distraught. I guess I just wanted to say it to someone. So... thanks.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,default,Empty,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2hx8w1/empty/,

203827,,True,clinteastwood1990,,,,"I am sometimes one of those downvoters and for the following reasons:   
  
Usually they are posts which go like this:   
   
1. ""I don't know if I am depressed.""   (seriously??)
    
2. ""My boyfriend left me and I **feel** depressed."" or ""I am in a depressed mood.     
    
3. I am not in treatment but I am sure I have depressions (go see a damn terapist!!! we are no professionals here and you can't get help with a single sentence and be happy again and usually what you need is something other than reddit that helps you.)   
   
Other things that annoy me are usually the ""helpers"", they go through the new posts and try to ""help"" you with some shallow advice and you can see on their accounts that they comment almost every damn new post with almost the same advice and they feel so damn awesome because they think they are helping.   
But I so hate that, it doesn't help me and most of the time if you ask something back you don't get an answer in return.  
And worse: those ""helpers"" prevent others from commenting on your post. Why? Because your post received a comment and it's not red anymore so people overlook it and think that your post has been cared for and that you have gotten some good advice.     
    
If a post is rather long and it starts serious and when I get the feeling that this person really needs help I usually upvote, I even upvote a lot of stuff because often my posts (I use a throwaway account where I mainly post about my problems) get downvoted too or only get one single comment and that comment is usually like this: **""Are you in treatment??? Durrr""""""**  That kills my post then, nobody else feels the need of commeting anymore because some helped me.    
   
On my throwaway account I also posted once or twice on /r/suicidewatch, you know what the first message is there which I receive?? **""call me if you need help, we can talk.""**    (usually those kind of people message like fifty people on the same day with ""call me and we can talk"".   
   
I hate them. Why? Maybe because I live in a country thousands of mile away from the USA where I have np idea how to call that person and usually calling a total teenage stranger is the last thing I want to do, I hate talking on the phone you know and I can imagine a lot of people with psychological problems hate talking on the phone. There are helplines, if I wished to use my voice and actually talk I'd call them. I just want to put it online and anonymous somewhere, **I don't need your fake sympathy.**    
   
Thanks for this post, I needed a place to actually put my two cents about this subreddit.   
   
We could do maybe like other subreddits a weekly thread? You know, where we can discuss and give advice to people and look that everyone gets some real help? Like I don't know, we could call it ""Manic Monday"" and each Monday there yould be that thread and we could help each other. Or a thread where we could post our achievements, you know even such tiny things like ""I showered today"" and that everyone thinks about something he/she did today. It sounds cheesy, but something like that could brighten up the mood in this rather sad place:/",,0.0,,2013-10-31 19:08:10,,,0,False,,,,0,,cd3wdgh,,,,,t3_1pmew0,,,t1_cd3wdgh,,,,t3_1pmew0,,,,,,,,1428909520.0,,26,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,26,,

-I am kinda homeless, my mother finally let me stay at her place for a couple days until I move into my apartment, she constantly asks me to baby my 21 year old brother (I'm 19) she keeps asking when I'm leaving, and tells me to leave on a daily bases. 

-My father is an alcoholic I can't conversate with him, he screams and yells and bitches, and just doesn't get that I'm asking him for advice.

-My car got taken, it was my home for a little bit, and now I have to depend on my counselor to drive me to my appointments, but that's hard since I'm an hour and half away from her.

-My mom wouldn't let my dogs stay, they are what keeps me sane, she set up something with this lady to watch them, and the lady is only giving one of them back and selling the other, after putting me through hell.

-I've been/was staying in a motel, my car, and bouncing around everywhere,  I was suppose to get my food stamps but JFS wanted a address verification paper, I kept telling them I was homeless but they didn't get the picture, and told me i had to reapply. 

-I'm constantly worrying about how I'm going to pay my bills and survive but my rent gets payed for, and once I pull 200$ out of my ass I plan on starting my ebay business back up and also plan on starting college.

-I want to try to get on medicine again, but I'm scared I'm going to OD again.

-I always think there is something wrong with me.

-I'm not good at nothing.

It's something that happens very often after I developed depression. And now that I have finally addressed my depression with her. The arguments haven't gotten any better. I found out new things about how my family has treated my depression. For years I thought that they didn't notice the change in me but I was wrong. They did notice the change and they made the decision to leave me alone when I needed them the most. I mean, I really needed them during those years and they knew all along that something was wrong. I withdrew from everything because I felt so alone and this entire time, they could've helped. They literally gave up on me. And up until recently, I did everything for them. My entire life had been a selfless act to please them so they would be happy with me. And it's all for nothing. I don't mean the same to them as they do to me. How can they consciously let me suffer like that?

Now I feel even more alone. The way my mom was talking to me and telling me made me feel like she just blames me for how I am like everything about my depression is my fault. She's telling me to change. And I feel so alone. I've always been insecure with myself. But I thought I worked through it. I relied on myself because no one else had ever encouraged me. Now I feel worthless. I knew that the rest of the world wouldn't care about me. But I thought my family would be my constant. They would love me no matter what. But now I see that I'm just a burden and a disappointment to them. Now I feel like I have nothing. I only have my broken self working through depression AND previously dealt with insecurities. I'm so far into my depression habits and I don't know how to get out of them. So I just stay in my room and refresh the tabs on my browser and cry. I have no friends and my family is not who I thought they were. I feel so alone, worse than before.

Depression is only so bad when you feel alone and your mind lies to you about how alone you actually are. But when the people you hold so close to you tell you that they gave up on you when you were the most depressed, it just breaks down any progress gained. It's heartbreaking to me and I can't help but cry.

66333,,True,naygor,,,,"SSRI's work by making serotonin stay in the synapse longer. This might be okay in the depressed brain, as serotonin function is suppressed, but under normal conditions the end result can be too much serotonin in the synapse (aka serotonin syndrome, symptoms: hypermanic, racing, unfocused thoughts, on edge, headache). This is a potentially fatal condition to have when it is the result of combining anti depressants with certain other serotogenic drugs. You shouldn't be in any immediate danger though as what you're experiencing are mild symptoms.

If you stay the course and continue taking this dose, what I imagine will happen is a desensitization of the serotonin receptors (your brain adapting to the amount of serotonin), which will make you feel normal while on anti depressants, but might have a difficult time getting off of them (brain has to re-adapt). I suggest you talk to your doctor about these symptoms and either lower your dose or finding an alternative.

1475,,True,FinerStuff,,,,"Actually your assumption is incorrect. I know from first hand experience. Even in Texas (one of the least liberal states in the country) I was repeatedly told by my psychiatrist that if I ever needed my medication and was unable to get it (either because insurance problems, because I could no longer afford it, or even if there was just a delay getting my prescription at the pharmacy) to come to them and they would give me enough free samples of the product to get me by. She also told me repeatedly to apply for assistance in paying for my medication and that I should never think that I couldn't take the medication I needed because of money and I should not assume I am ineligible just because I'm employed.

This is what the OP should do--she should talk to her doctor (or call her doctor's office in order to avoid paying for an office visit.) I never applied for any kind of assistance, never took my psychiatrist up on her offers for free samples--I just suffered because I assumed I would never qualify for assistance because I was employed, and that I wasn't justified in accepting free samples.

It's really annoying that people talk smack about healthcare in America when it's not really that it's so bad, it's that *nobody understands it, nobody is informed about it or can figure it out, and basically very few people are even remotely aware of the assistance that is available.* I hear so many people talk out of complete ignorance about how cold healthcare is here, when the reality is that the person talking just does not know enough of what they are talking about to know that there are people there to help them if they will go to a little trouble. I guess people want not just affordable healthcare, but easy healthcare which requires no effort whatsoever to acquire, not even filling out an application for medication assistance.

I worked in a law office about a decade and most clients were a part of a sad story -- even adoptions (someone was losing as well as someone gaining a child) and even some of the real estate work.  

One summer when I didn't work I found out my mom watched soap operas and I tried them for a few weeks.  It was like inviting all that angst into my home unnecessarily.

Both experiences are inviting really sad stuff to be a part of daily life and I found it to be somewhere between being a bit of a downer to truly depressing.  Some of the saddest cases tended to manifest themselves in bits of bad dreams. (They stopped when I quit.)

The problem may not be with your life, per se, but with the ""stories"" your subconscious is embracing.

I've actually heard about some people who see an actor in public and address the actor as if he/she were a character the actor had played.  Some stories are just that strong.

Taking in the sadness of those around you can unduly magnify the imperfect moments in your own life all out of proportion to reality.  Hopefully, figuring out the trigger for the episode can help you avoid it in the future.

Your scientific support seems interesting - might have to look into that. It's hard to stop comparing and contrasting. Especially in a world where you 95% *must* compare yourself to others and adjust accordingly to be successful (think resumes, jobs, dating), letting go of that mindset can be scary.

Thank you for your thoughts though, and I'll definitely keep them in mind - maybe ill be successful on acting on them, I don't know.

We’ve been talking for about 5 years now, and I haven’t told her how I felt. In our first year of we became really close. (she even knows about my depression, but I would never tell her why) I’ve never been able to connect with any other person like I have with her, and she is just incredible. Well 2 years into our friendship, we’ve been talking on and off because she has had a boyfriend. She came to me out of random when we hadn’t talked for a couple months to explain to me how incredibly happy she’s been with this guy. I of course congratulate her and talk for a bit, even though every word she said hurt, I listened and acted fine. I don’t hear from her for a couple months and then she approaches me again. Her exact words were “hey, you know since you’re my best friend in the whole world, do you think you can do me a favor?” I of course said sure. She then asked me if I would be able to, very soon, go to the store and pick her up a home pregnancy test. This devastated me. I felt cold all of a sudden, as I shook it off and told her I would. I was afraid. But I did it anyways (I consider this the day that my depression really started). She then took it later that week when I got it to her and it read negative. Then she continued to date the same guy for about another year until he cheated on her. Again, having not talked to her in that entire year got me feeling kind of lost. I still loved her but I couldn’t tell her. She came to me again so down about it. She was so depressed for the next couple of months. But I was there for her every step of the way for her to talk to. Then, just as soon as I get her back up on her feet and feeling great again, in another couple of months, she ditches me and finds another boyfriend.. I start to think that I’m not worth much to her, and that there’s no chance. I almost moved on too. Except she had to come back to me and bring me back down. But I still loved her. I was still willing to be there for her. Has this been a mistake? I couldn’t tell.  She came back to me again about 2 months ago because the new boyfriend she had, had cheated on her again just like the last. I decided to risk it again, feeling more depressed than ever, and feeling more used than I had been in my whole life. But she was hurting, and because I still loved her for who she was, I helped. (and all at the same time her ex that just cheated on her is trying to get back with her). The past couple weeks I thought things were going great, she and I were hanging out tons more, talking more, and we even went to prom together. And it was actually at that prom that I decided to just go for it, because throughout the night she kept just telling me that she loved me. I didn’t know what to think. So today I told her how I felt. That I loved her, and had always loved her for the past 5 years and how seeing her with all the other guys was linked to my depression. She simply told me that she didn’t feel the same way, and still has feelings for her ex who just cheated on her. Now I feel like shit, almost embarrassed about the entire thing. Im feeling incredible depressed right now, and I have no idea where to go from here. Ive given the last 5 years up to her and ive been there for her every time shes been hurt, and ive got nothing now… I feel terrible knowing that the asshole that cheated on her in the first place is, is better to her than I am.

""It makes you lose hope and objectivity. It places you in a hole that you have no idea how to get out of. It warps the world like a pair of shitty beer goggles. It makes you only remember sadness and regret. Any happiness seems dim and faint. Spending a day alone feels like you’ve been on a deserted island for years. Small things make you feel exhausted. Guilt from lack of success is overbearing.

The sadness from depression incapacitates and cripples you. I remember at twenty feeling like my life had passed me by. The amount of weight and muscle I lost one summer had gotten to point where I was starting to resemble a skeleton. I would fantasize about being in a relationship with a beautiful woman who cared deeply about me. My other fantasies involved various ways I wanted to commit suicide. I’d have to spend a lot of time in the sun because it didn’t fell like the sunlight was hitting me. Nights felt like an eternal darkness.

It's important to keep your depression treated because it can have a very real effect on your life

I take an anti-depressant everyday and I meet with a therapist every week or two. In my therapy sessions I have to work hard to address my issues (meeting once a month and making small talk doesn’t do it for me). This helps keep my depression in remission which returns control and happiness to my life. It lets me see through the fog.

When my depression is in remission I'm charismatic, everyone is a friend, I work out regularly, multiple women are interested in me and my future is bright.

I went to /r/suicidewatch first but I'm not suicidal just really depressed and I have no one to talk to.

I'm just depressed. I feel really helpless and worthless and on top of that I feel guilty for being depressed because it all seems like things that would be different if I just DO something different but I don't, and I can't figure out how to break out of the 'depressed because I'm not changing things ... not changing things because I'm depressed' cycle.

Here are the facts: I'll be 33 in a month. I'm unemployed, I have no marketable job skills that I am aware of. I have no friends, I'm not really close to my family, I have no driver's license. I'm excessively overweight and borderline agoraphobic - that is, when I have to leave the house and I know I can't get back right away or on my own terms (like if I'm riding with someone and can't get back until they do), I become very agitated and anxious.

I currently live with my 25 year old sister and take care of her baby while she works. My mother is paying half the rent from her pension check in order for me to be there full time for the baby. The only money I have is what little my sister can give me for child care each week. I'm not happy. My life has no direction. Taking care of the baby is rewarding sometimes, other times it depresses me more. I can't find my purpose, but on the other hand, I'm not looking very hard. The internet is my addiction. It's the only thing that distracts me from my life long enough to make me feel better for a little while, but the moment I stop doing that I'm disgusted with myself for spending so much time on it instead of doing something purposeful. Sometimes I resent the baby needing attention because I want to stay on the internet (and on dumb stuff. Text games, facebook, and yes - reddit, nothing even remotely useful to a fulfilling life).

I have NO close friends. I'm not good with people. The closest person to me is my mom, and she's hard to confide in because I just end up feeling guilty. Pretty much every job I've ever held or anything I've ever done is because she's done it, trying to help me find my path, but all I feel now is resentment for constantly being pushed into what other people want me to do and not having control over my own life.

But the thing is, I don't have any goals or plans or even... interests outside of messing around online. So when someone wants me to do something (like this thing of taking care of my little sister's baby) I do it because I had nothing better to do. But it's not what *I* want to do, so I get depressed. Yet I don't KNOW what I want to do so I continue doing what other people want me to do.

I don't know where I'm going with this. I want some control over my life, but when left to my own devices, I just turn to stupid things that will distract me from thinking about it. I feel like I'm afraid to live, but to keep going the way I have been is killing me. Sometimes I want more than anything to just say ""fuck it"" and walk off and don't look back, but I'm afraid of leaving my comfort zone and my mind comes up with all sorts of excuses why I can't do this or that or the other.  I feel like I KNOW the answer is to just DO something - anything. And yet I don't. Day after day I wake up and do the same exact thing and then by the end of the day I hate myself for it, yet I get up and do it again.

My weight is part of my anxiety, it's part of why I don't feel comfortable going out in public, and being out for long periods of time will end up being painful. I think - just lose the weight, it will help with my confidence, it will motivate me to get out there and do more things - maybe I'll be able to apply for jobs or socialize once I'm thinner and feel like I can face people... but I can't motivate myself to do even THAT.  And like I said, on top of all of that, I feel guilty for not changing my life and for complaining about not being happy instead of doing something. Then I feel more depressed because I'm self-loathing over my self-pity.  It's a crazy damn cycle, and I want off this ride.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,"Hi, I  just need to talk",9,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12hjcf/hi_i_just_need_to_talk/,

I have not been diagnosed by a doctor with depression - my doctor lives back home so I don't see here often, and although I briefly mentioned it, she wanted to wait and have another check up later on. However, I'm 99% certain I had depression all throughout first year of University. My friend who has been diagnosed with depression would help me through my rough times, and explain to me that my symptoms were too intense and constant to be just sadness. I fought really hard with myself to not end my life, and I'm not sure how I even did it, but I'm still here today so.

My question is, while my depression has improved (I think because I've developed ways of coping) is it normal to have phases of sorts? I mean, now it's going to sound more like bipolar disorder, but I will have times when things are doing okay, and then suddenly for a week or two, it's like my depression is back full force, and I sometimes even slip back into the suicidal part, where I can't keep convincing myself I have things to live for. I also still have what I consider the ""fallout"" of depression (aka, I was not like this before I had depression): I have much lower self-esteem and confidence, I get anxiety and panic attacks  (I don't remember ever having a panic attack before having depression). It makes it really hard for me to even try to have a good time when I'm with other people - and this was never a problem before.

I guess I'm wondering how you know if you're actually depressed. I kind of feel like identifying myself as feeling or being depressed may be wrong. I don't want to take away from people who are actually suffering from such a difficult disorder by self-pitying and assuming my laziness is caused by something outside of my own control. But for the past few months I've found it difficult to do things I could normally do. I've always been a heavy procrastinator, but lately it's been out of control. For example, I had a paper due last week, and I just haven't done it. And normally that would cause some anxiety an stress but it's not like i've been too busy to get to it, I just don't care. And I'm tired, like alot. It feels like whenever I encounter something I don't want to deal with like something as simple as returning library books I just want to got to bed. I find it hard to get up in the morning without hitting my snooze button for about an hour until I finally drag myself out of bed. And concentration, which has never been too difficult for me in the past seems impossible now. I can't even sit trough a full class period. I rarely want to leave the house to do things, and when I do I usually just end up driving around aimlessly instead of going where I was supposed to go. My self-worth also has hit an all-time low. I feel as if I'm constantly failing, and any intelligence or strength and confidence I once had is almost completely diminished. I just feel like I don't even know myself anymore, and all I do is hurt the people around me with my self-absorbed and selfish behavior. And I want to change and fix these things but I don't know how. I just feel stuck in this endless cycle of self-pity and laziness. It's not like I don't feel happy sometimes. Like at work my coworkers can make me laugh and I smile alot. But I feel as though I don't actually have any friends anymore. I have my boyfriend, who I live with and he's essentially the only person I have contact with. I have old friends who I still talk to occasionally, but thy live far away. And my family tries to call me and talk to me alot but I don't ever feel like talking to them, and when I do I often lie about how I'm doing or feeling. I guess I just don't know.

Then about a year later, I started going out to bars actively seeking women, just talking to lots of women... lots of one night stands... after all those years in a relationship i indirectly learnt how to deal with women. But no girl would compare to my ex, so i didn't stay with any of them. I think i have a fake image of her in my mind, I'm ignoring all her negative aspects...  I wish i could tell you a better story.

Yeah job market is slow all over, but once you find a job, i hope it will be the catalyst you need to get back on track. I did a spot of volunteering, its a good way to get out and about, do new things, meet new people and even put it on your CV if relevant.. go for it. 

I'm really pleased that my comments were encouraging :) all the best.

I had to try a few different types before I settled on one that I feel is right for me. You have the right to refuse certain medications if you feel they do not benefit you. I refuse to be labelled with a condition but I do know that sometimes we all need a little bit of help.

I try to think of the medication like a stepping stool to reach a shelf taller that I couldn't reach on my own. The medication I take makes little things seem the right size. Rather than throwing a temper tantrum, crying or pulling my hair out because I dropped a plate; now I just pick it back up. Previously I knew, logically; it was just a plate but my medication enables me to act appropriately.

When I first started on my tablets, I found the best way to deal with the fear was to keep myself busy with other things. You probably won't notice any difference for a few weeks and by the time you do, in hindsight you'll probably wonder why you were scared at all. 

Out of curiosity, are you being medicated for all 3 conditions for the first time simultaneously? My doctor found that being medicated for one condition initially can alleviate the symptoms of all.

Just remember, If you feel ill or stressed whilst taking the meds, tell your doctor. Good Luck. :)",,0.0,,2012-10-21 11:06:28,,,0,False,,,,0,,c6pmcvg,,,,,t3_11tpdi,,,t1_c6pmcvg,,,,t3_11tpdi,,,,,,,,1430202435.0,,2,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,2,,

So around a year ago, I had my first real steady girlfriend. We only really went out for a month, but we really loved each other. Long story short, I broke up with her a day or two after her birthday because I was talking to this girl I had been on and off with for the past two years, and I didn't think it was fair to my gf to be in a relationship where I'm not completely loyal to her. About a week later me and this other girl I was talking to got in a big fight and we called anything that was reconstructing off. That pretty much made my first six months of senior year the worst I've really ever experienced. I felt like a dick because not only did I throw away a relationship that I really cared about and hurt her feelings, I also felt really bad about the circumstances around the break up. In late November/early December she proposed to get back together because we still talked afterward and we both missed each other, but I wound up declining because I felt we'd both already been through too much to just go back to being together, and we weren't the same people we'd first met and fell in love with. Around late December though I met a girl at a formal and a month later I got the strength to ask her to hang out. On Valentine's Day I asked get to go steady with a very elaborate TARDIS journal present (we were both DW fans). Although this happened, I still felt bad about my past gf even though we had cut ties and decided not to stay in contact with each other, but after being in a relationship with my new gf for a month, it evolved into more just feeling like a bad person in general. I started to cut, and a week or so after I started I told her about it, and she revealed she did it too, so we kinda helped each other stop. I felt so close to her, and I've never loved anyone or anything with this capacity before. Prom was fun, she looked more beautiful than anything I've ever seen, and just hanging out with her and her friends in my arms afterward is still the best memory I have. We were kinda long distance, so it was sorta hard to hang out sometimes, and eventually we went on a period of time where we hadn't seen each for about two or three weeks. Eventually, right before my AP Stats Exam, she called me and broke it off; she wanted to start a clean slate in college and she felt she ""wasn't giving me what I was looking for"". I was too shocked to say anything so I really just said okay and that's how that went. After this I went back to self harm to the point where there really wasn't a party of my fore-arm that wasn't red or scabbed or bleeding. I didn't eat for a while, didn't go out, etc. Aaaaand here we are now.

So, my peers of r/depression, what should I do? I don't want to forget these two great girls in my life, for they've both added to some of my best memories and made some of my greatest friends, but when I remember even just a bit of them I'm just filled with so much pain to the point where I need to leave the room and sit alone in a room alone (this really only happens with the latest one though, and rarely ever the other one).

Obviously, it would be better if there were no cheating in the world, but if your partner is cheating on you, then consider yourself lucky if you get to find out because you get the chance to see your partner for who they really are and you don't have to continue investing your time and emotions in a complete lie. 

Just know that you are not alone in your experience. There are so many good people who have been through something similar and they survived it and absolutely empathize with you. We all live and hopefully we all get to learn. It can be a great learning experience to see where we made mistakes and then figure out how we're going to do it differently and treat ourselves better the next time around. 

Anytime you're in a relationship where your partner is cheating on you, there is an element of abuse- abuse of trust, abuse of power, abuse of information, abuse of emotions, etc. I don't doubt for a second that this relationship was absolutely draining for you, and the last thing you need when you're dealing with depression is a lying, cheating, abusive partner. 

Don't give this guy another ounce of your energy. Now you can see him for who he truly is, which is someone who isn't worth your time. You are the best thing that ever happened to you, and now you can focus all your energy on getting better and being better.

In November, crushing anxiety showed up and changed things a bit.  Suicidal thoughts were becoming more an more normal.  

In January, my supervisor put me on probation.  The reasons I'm on probation all have to do with depression (and partially because of ADD)-poor organization, not being able to form relationships with people I work with, ""looking like I don't enjoy my job.""  She'll decide by the end of the month if I'm allowed to keep my job.  

Of course, being depressed I'm not enjoying my job.  But I'm not enjoying anything else, either.  In my last meeting it sounded like she had made up her mind not to keep me.  Sometimes I'll think of suicide to ""get back"" at her for treating me so badly in the years I've known her, but I know that's stupid, and I won't do it.  But this woman is just...a piece of work, to put it kindly.

She literally said to me once that she wants to see me ""sparkle.""  I'm sorry, but depressed people do not ""sparkle.""  

I've been in therapy since January, but only talked about my suicidal feelings a week or so ago.  That suddenly made my therapist seem to care a lot more.  She wants me to start antidepressants because my mood is so low that I can't work on the things she wants me to work on.  

I have a week off at the end of the month, so I was thinking of starting antidepressants then, so I have a week to be a potentially crazy person without giving my supervisor another reason to get rid of me.  But my doctor says she wants me to start them right away because of the whole suicidal thoughts thing.  And who knows, maybe the antidepressants will be miraculous and give me no trouble?  

I'm not sure if I should tell my supervisor about my depression.  I'm not sure if it would make it better or not.  I don't know that I'm looking for any response tonight, but I am sitting at home alone and thinking things over, trying to decide if there's anything I can do to control my situation.

32859,,True,anonanon1313,,,,"I, too, was abused a lot as a kid (mostly emotional, some physical, no sexual). I pissed away almost 10 years of my life with a girl who was beautiful and could be quite affectionate but was really quite domineering and manipulative. I was terrified of being alone, but finally broke it off when I realized I was still pretty lonely with her and got tired of her constant, subtle put downs.

Breaking up was the hardest thing I ever did, it felt like I was cutting off an arm or something. I was afraid I would be forever alone. I bounced back a couple of times. She went right out and replaced me with a couple of guys who looked a lot like me and were really wussy. That brought the pattern into sharper focus.

When I finally started dating again, I realized I was being attracted to another very attractive but controlling woman who had a long list of things she wanted to change about me. It was the same whipsaw of affection and disapproval. I went for it like catnip (sticking with the theme). One night, I just had a flash of insight/sanity and just went NOPE and walked away.

I eventually hooked up with a girl who had a long history of dick boyfriends. It was hard at first, there was chemistry, but at first it felt like the wrong formula. It was like slow dancing with neither of us leading. It took us forever to get our mutual shit straight. We dated for 8 years and did a lot of therapy. We didn't dick around with each other, so that was different. We just had our 25th wedding anniversary and have been crazy happy together.

If you have a long history of abuse, you tend to get conditioned for Mr./Mrs. wrong -- no news there. You can change that.

Does anyone else have periods where they're relatively fine, and then suddenly it's consistent depression for weeks on end? I was fine(ish) until a few weeks ago when my head decided that depression every night and morning would be a fun idea.

The whole ordeal is leaving me terribly shaken and almost unable to leave my room. I have temporarily ceased contact with all my friends because I am finding it more and more difficult to engage in social interaction. My emotions are in rapid flux between high and low which I swear is probably one of the best ways to break someone. Agonising but I'm starting to feel life is a stupid charade and going insane would be a relief, so maybe it's not all bad.

And I keep wanting to cry. That's been a consistent thing since this all started almost a year ago. Yet not once I've cried, my body denying me of some emotional release for whatever sadistic reason. Why the fuck can't I cry? I'll tear up slightly say at one of the last scenes of Schindler's List, or even at one bit in fucking Toy Story 3 but when I actually need it? Nothing.

I fucking hate myself. Can't even fucking cry. How useless is that? The one thing I should be good at in my state and I can't even do that. I feel like I'm a peripheral burden to every conversation, like I'm some unwanted presence. Somehow being aware of my obvious bias doesn't aid me in changing my mind here. Just like how I can feel like a fucking burden to everyone yet part of my reason for not killing myself is due to how people would feel.

My concern about antidepressants is that although I should report to my doctor if it happens, there is a good chance I will not.  If I am that depressed it would be too tempting to finally have a suicide method on hand that I find acceptable.

The work issue is complicated.  I have taken several days off when I have felt I have been felt too unstable/sick to be productive, and rest would be more helpful.  But it hasn't helped.  Instead of resting I fret about not going to work, and then I am more stressed about going back the next day.

Each event with it's own story and problems but drowned out in crys from the rest. Together it's all static.

I want help. Physical help from people who know what they are doing. Without money that will not happen. I cannot work due to physical and mental reasons. The little help which is available is just not enough. I've been thru it so many times, each time they send me packing because they handle the immediate crisis while ignoring the long term problems. 

I lack any motivation, I only leave the house for appointments which is very painful due to physical conditions. So even when I do want to walk to the shop, I come back in agony and exhausted, back in bed. Pain is a big part of my life. It rules me. Dictates what I can and can't do. The can do is now limited to sit in the chair, lay in bed, or make a drink or food. I take baths when I can, on a day I can stand the pain. I've recently conditioned myself to remember to brush my teeth everyday. Sometimes I'll go to a friends house but I go knowing it means the next few days in bed recovering. 

What do you do when you physically can't get up every day, when pain dictates your every move, depression dictates your every thought, you see no meaning to a life but you don't want to hurt those around you by dieing. When the only help is a bandaid when what you need reconstructive surgery.

36401,,True,blindscreams,,,,"Hi OP,

(I am on my phone so apologize for typos or formatting in advance!)

You are being very very mature about all of this. Props to you.

It can be very scary to return to the real world after a hospitalization and its normal to sometimes feel like you're not ready yet to return. Give your prescriptions a chance to work and most importantly make sure you are seeing someone.

It seems like you have a supportive mother and that is great. Absolutely tell her if you feel the urge to self-harm or feel suicidal or even if you begin to have thoughts. Yes, this may lead to another hospitalization but dont worry about that! the important part is absolutely to get help and tell an adult! Especially if you feel like your mood worsens or if you feel like you start to have any new symptoms (racing thoughts, feeling super super happy in an abnormal way, anything that deviates from your normal!!).

I worked as a direct care worker with teenage girls aged 13-18 in a residential program. Many of these very strong girls struggled with depression and were hospitalized and came to us as a transition before going home. We helped them learn how to cope with stressors in their environment and how to substitute ""harmful"" behaviors such as cutting with positive self-control strategies. With this in mind, I will try to give you some pointers (this isn't perfect as you really really should be working with a professional on these! But I figure you can at least get started on your own!):

- First, consider journaling. Whenever you feel upset, write about how you're feeling and most importantly try to explore WHY you feel that way. Was there anything that set you off? When you're upset, what does that look like? Can you notice any patterns? Are there any thoughts you repeat to yourself that you know aren't true but can't help but feel like that? Do this if you feel like self-harming or have any suicidal thoughts too! The point with journaling is this: try to find your triggers so you can learn how to counter them and also to help you identify thoughts and behaviors that may be the ""depression"" talking (guilty thoughts or thoughts about how you're worthless for instance) and finally to help you notice any patterns in sleep or eating and whether your meds affect you!

- when you feel the urge to self-harm, DON'T. It will be hard. But instead, try to use something else. Make a list of things that help make you feel better when you're upset: dancing, singing, painting, sports, writing, reading, music (please avoid sad/depressing songs while you're upset! You might feel like it helps but it could do the opposite!), etc. when upset, revert to this list! Most importantly, if you're at the point of thinking of self-harm, do one of the following: chew on ice, take a cold/hot shower, throw ice cubes at a wall, freeze an orange then roll it around in your hands, or wet a small towel and freeze it all twisted up then try to untwist it. These are all sensory things that might help you get through the urge to self-harm.

- last but not least, use a process called thought stopping. Whenever you find yourself spiraling into bad thoughts (I suck, life isn't worth it, I should just kill myself/harm myself, etc) literally think or even say out loud STOP! Then, consciously think of something else or go journal or go use one of your list from above!!! The idea here is to help you become more aware of yourself and to help stop you from getting to that point.

Phew sorry for the long post! I won't use a TL;DR because this is all very important. I hope this helps you! Once again, please please find a psychologist you like and attend faithfully!!! There is really nothing better to help. The meds will help, certainly, but a psychologist will make sure you know how to help yourself! And that will last you a lifetime.

Finally, please if I can help you in any way feel free to PM me. :) I wish you all the best and know that it absolutely does get better! The adolescents I worked with are all real world examples of this!! :) I am confident you will be another one of these examples!!! Much luck to you and work hard.

But yeah. I used to work for Apple so I've actually had to tell people something similarly. Not quite as idiotic as someone's FACE being incompatible though, wtf. 

No, I've gotten my phone replaced and it happens every time I go into a residential area. It's totally them. Having worked on their side of the phones, you really know what to say to get what you need. 

Anyway, I see what you're getting at. I've been trying not to do that, I really have. I actually do this thing before I get SUPER bad where I go online or around town and look for freebies to get.

For everybody that's not familiar with my situation, read my past posts to get a better idea. My 'friend' is now talking to me after I completely lied and said that everything that they did was my fault. It wasn't. But now that he's talking to me, I don't know if I should bring this up now. But, they don't want me to visit and I don't want to have a talk with them unless it's done in person. Chances are anyway, when I bring up the real facts of what happened to them, they're going to go back to blaming me and ignoring me.  Everything is “my fault” after all, not theirs, despite the fact that most of this problem was caused by them. His mom is like a 13 year old bratty girl, when things don't go her way, it's everybody elses fault but hers. Hell she even talks like one when she sent me text messages.


I really wish I was able to do what one of my online friends said to do, as in just completely drop all communication and forget about them in a snap. Honestly I would like to do that at this point, but I can't. I'm still emotionally attached and it's extremely difficult to let go.

1) Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. A bleak outlook—nothing will ever get better and there’s nothing you can do to improve your situation. 2) Loss of interest in daily activities. No interest in former hobbies, pastimes, social activities, or sex. You’ve lost your ability to feel joy and pleasure. 3) Appetite or weight changes. Significant weight loss or weight gain—a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month. 4) Sleep changes. Either insomnia, especially waking in the early hours of the morning, or oversleeping (also known as hypersomnia). 5) Anger or irritability. Feeling agitated, restless, or even violent. Your tolerance level is low, your temper short, and everything and everyone gets on your nerves. 6) Loss of energy. Feeling fatigued, sluggish, and physically drained. Your whole body may feel heavy, and even small tasks are exhausting or take longer to complete. 7) Self-loathing. Strong feelings of worthlessness or guilt. You harshly criticize yourself for perceived faults and mistakes. 8) Reckless behavior. You engage in escapist behavior such as substance abuse, compulsive gambling, reckless driving, or dangerous sports. 9) Concentration problems.

I'm a 19y/o male in Vancouver but the story starts when im 18. My name is Alex and  i grew up poor, got bullied for all of school, and only had a mom (dad was abusive, he lives in a different province and doesn't pay child support).

Back in Sept i almost killed myself. I felt that the world didn't give a shit about me. I spent 15 months job searching, I had no friends, and I had no money. I made a post on facebook that i had given up and wanted to end my life. Thank god I posted there otherwise i might have done it,  I was stopped by a message from a former classmate and I felt better because i could see she meant everything she said.

What she said may have picked me up out of suicide, but it didn't get rid of my depression. So i tried any idea i could think of to make myself feel better. The first one was buying a (very cheap) [stuffed monkey](http://i.imgur.com/Af2RT.jpg) So i could have something to keep me company and hug on those really bad days. It worked for about a month. it stopped working when thanksgiving rolled around in October and we (my mom and I) went to my grandparents house just to realize how disconnected from the rest of the family we were. My Cousins where either becoming a kicker for the BC lions, going to be a nanny in Italy, or owned a very successful business. Also we learned like three of my aunts had died in the last 3 years and no one decided to tell my mom or I. 

Then my birthday rolled around and I had realized that besides my mom there was no one to wish me a happy birthday in person. This was also the first year my grandparents didn't send me a card, they just asked my mom to give me the money and transferred it to her, This hurt more then it should have. Later that week i got a phone call from a interview i had done the week before and got a cashier job, this lifted my mood greatly.

So i went to my first day training and saw that i was not the only Cashier being trained, There was a Female 4 months younger then me ( i learned this at a later date btw). Little did i know that over the course of the rest of the training i would grow a crush on her. I added her on facebook just to find out that she already had a BF, yet again this hurt more then it should have. i started to fell close to how i felt when i wanted to kill myself, so i started [writing it all down in a journal](http://i.imgur.com/NYffR.jpg) and this helped me feel better for a while. i made some good resolutions but after a while i became sick of it, i would write a sentence or two and then stop because i found it stupid.

I felt that even if she was single she would not want to be with me. I am not a guy in shape, i don't have a good face, I don't know how to be sociable, and i give up to easily. [So i tried writing a note to myself and taped it to the wall](http://i.imgur.com/arwDl.jpg) I wanted to improve myself, but it quickly died out. I still want to Improve myself but I can't get motivated.

So i worked, i talked to her semi-regularly, and hid my emotions in public just to feel real bad when i let them out at home. I got my first  pay so i decided that maybe i would treat myself ( okay $269 was overboard) to[ my first camera](http://i.imgur.com/1mPl7.jpg)  and maybe taking pictures would help. I bought this camera yesterday, and all it has done is made me feel like shit and reminded me that i don't have anyone to talk to in person.

 Now i am posting this all out of ideas of things to make me feel better. Every so often i will look at threads on /r/lonely and /r/depression to try and help people, but i get through one or two threads then i can't go on anymore. 

i hate feeling like this, i try so many things to try and make myself feel better, but nothing works for long. even as i write this i feel more down then when i started. i don't know what to do....

Just things we do to feel better for that fleeting split second, then it's gone and you're back in the abyss staring up and trying to think if you'll climb out one day.

It really doesn't help that my doctors office is fucking stupid and you have to call at 8am to make an appointment, I've called everyday for the past ten days and it's been engaged. 

I'll have to go in to make an appointment but it's on the other end of town so I'll have to wake up ridiculously early so I can get to work on time.


Some days I'll feel fine and then others, days like today. If I had something ~~definite~~ a high probability like a gun, if I'm honest with myself I think I'd point it at my brain from whichever angle (the classic at the temple, a thinking mans suicide or do you go for the under chin method? Now that is *the* question) and pull the trigger.


I'm not even sure what therapy would accomplish and if that doesn't work I don't want to be on meds, I see what they do to people, practically turning them into zombies.

I like your use of quotes around friend who told you those terrible, horrible, cliche phrases.

I don't know if you're bipolar, but it was a pretty douche move for him to even tell you he thought you might be. That is just not something you say to someone to make them feel better.

Do you take walks listening to music now in Maryland? I'm sure there are just some beautiful spots to walk around there. Just lying back in the grass looking at the sky watching the people in the city below live their lives. Maybe not directly on the grass.. fuck spiders, and bugs.

Long walks during non-windy sunny days are really nice. The sun is so warm, but the wind is cold. After a long walk in the sun, it's nice to just sit back and play WoW. Well, it used to be fun playing wow... until diablo3 came out. Now everyone is on that.

And I mean a lot! I finally moved in with my fiancée (who is incredibly supportive) and I'm on my own two feet which feels great.

Here's where I need help. I started a new job which I hate. And I mean HATE! I've been struggling day in, day out, and I can feel it pushing me back towards the edge. I can feel it getting worse and worse every day, and I'm petrified that I'm going to be where I was not just a few months ago.

What do I do? I can't bare the thought of not living with my partner, so I need the money, but this job is ruining all my progress and is making me think of things that I haven't considered for a long time. I've started to go to bed at night wishing I don't wake up. And today I found myself staring at a kitchen knife with a sought of lust. 

The people I work with are awful and unsympathetic, the customers I serve are so condescending, but the main issue is the hours. My partner is working days, and I mainly work evenings, so I literally never see her. She is gone when I wake up, and asleep when I get home. It's killing me. She is my whole life, and whilst I appreciate how lucky I am to have her in my life, and for her to be so supportive, I feel like I'm living alone, and that she's missing from my life. That is what is hurting the most.

Please, any advice for anyone that's been in a similar situation, or has advice on what I could do. Sorry if this isn't the right sort of post for this sub-reddit, but I couldn't think of many other people to turn to.

If medication is the best thing to manage your symptoms, then you should take it, just like you would if you had a heart condition or high blood pressure or whatever other physical ailment. 

The best way to know what is the right solution for you is to go and talk to a doctor. There is this thing called doctor-patient confidentiality, which means your doctor can't tell your parents what's going on with you unless they think it is potentially life-threatening. If you can't go to your family doctor alone, or if you don't have a family doctor, try a walk-in clinic or a school counsellor. Most high schools and colleges have one. 

Some alternatives to medication are regular exercise, therapy or counselling, eating healthy foods, getting enough sunlight, etc. Again, the best way to know which solution will work for you is to talk things out with a doctor.

I don't even know what to say. I just need to say this stuff to someone, or else I might lose it. And I'm sorry if I ramble or if formatting and what not(mobile). I'm at work right now and i feel as if I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I don't cry often... I didn't have a great childhood... Bullied but I mean who wasn't really. Anyways... I'm so tired. Have you ever gotten the urge to just sleep, and not just sleep sleep, but like sleep and hope you wake up in a better place.

I am just so done with this world. I'm mad at everything, and I want to yell at everyone. But I never fucking say anything. It make me feel so fucking pathetic everytime I lack the ability to talk. I tell myself good job you tried but the other part of me just says your a fucking worthless piece of shit. I can't talk to the beautiful, drop dead, fucking girls I sit next to in my classes. I mean Jesus what I wouldn't give to actually ask what her fucking name is. Then after that feeling passes I remember I have a pregnant girlfriend and I start feeling guilty and this feeling in my stomach.

I know that sounds bad like, ""why do you wanna flirt with other girls when you have a pregnant girlfriend. That's bad.""  I know it is, but I'm so miserable. I've been with my girl for almost a year now and she's about 6 months pregnant. We were happy at first, but I was... Am an emotion wreck since my ex from a few years ago. Everything moved so fast.. We were dating... Then I asked her to move it and that's when my feelings began to change. She is lazy she does absolutely nothing. I cook, clean, laundry, work, and school... And she sleeps in till 1 or so. She's stopped working because of her pregnancy. And I've tries talking to her about how I want her to help. But she always comes up with an excuse because of the pregnancy. Like I got nauses or my stomach hurt. And I'm honestly just sick of the bitching and moaning from her. I just want one fucking day without a complaint. And I keep telling myself its because she is pregnant... It's the hormones once its over she'll be better. But I remember how she was before and it was just the same. I've completely lost my attraction to her but she constantly wants sex so I have to fantasize about other girls just to get off. I wanted to leave her but when I tried she freaked out and I can't handle making people sad. So I stayed and when I was gonna leave again we found out she was pregnant. I love my child already so I've stayed and tried to make the best of the situation... But I can't help feeling I want someone better. I don't wanna leave my child so I'm content with living with my gf forever. Because honestly I can't even do better so why bother.

I have one good friend who is basically exactly like me but the opposite. He's good looking and charming... I'm not.

Sometimes I wish I was him. It would be so much easier. 

The saddest thing is I just keep acting happy. I mean no one even suspects that's I just want to cry everyday. That I wanna grab the girl next to me and just tell her everything. That I just want someone to hold me so I can cry. But I can't because I got to be a rock for my girlfriend and I basically hate all my family because there filthy abusive bloodsucking animals... But whatever. I'm just starting to not care about anything anymore... Or anyone... Or myself... Except her... My beautiful baby. She's the only light I have left, but I'm so terrified of being a shitty parent. Idk what to say anymore. I feel worse now. So meh. Thanks for reading.

I have been living in a new city for about a year, have made some friends, no romantic relationships, and have been ""meh"" about my job.  

The worse thing about this is how much of my brain power is occupied on this... feeling. It's like there is little room for anything else, things that could benefit me because I love them. It has sort of ravaged me this past week.

Where do I post this even? -Why- do I do this? These are questions running around in my head right now. And forgive any spelling errors, strange syntax and cluttered format. English is not my native language, nor have I slept for a few days.

I am a norwegian guy, 26 years of age and live in a ""big"" city. Making this short and coherent is a problem, because its a multifacetted problem. I have reached the end of the line somewhat, exhausted many options and dont know what to do.

Life isnt easy, we all know that. But some are just unlucky, its that simple. We dont choose our circumstance, nobody does or can. Lately, I have been reaching a level of exhaustion that is not good. And its not alot of stuff around to keep one going. Been having really rough nights, im talking about nights with whisky and a gun on the table. Yeah, those nights.

What keeps me back is the alot of the fact that brought me up to this point. Not much of a life, and alot of hardships i dont wish upon anyone. This is usually the part where people open their mouths and say ""yeah, i know what you are talking about."" No, you dont. It would be sad to let go, and have achieved nothing. To let it go to waste. Heck, some even say I have potential for something great. That keeps me back, but im getting tired.

I dont want to start a mile long post now, how I was beaten bloody by my own family, watch some of them drink themselves to death, battle chronic illness, wipe the blood of my suicidal ex off the walls, spent so much time in relative destitution. I can go on, and on. To such a degree that even my own psychologist have suggested that I should write a book. I just dont have the energy and focus to.

Point is, this has all taken its toll. And I have reached out many a time. What I have discovered that this is a surefire way of making your friends disappear. Its not that they dont care. Its just that, in a country where people are relatively privileged. There a very few incentives to give a fuck about others, and the less fortunate. Norway, is a cold country in more ways than one. To the extent, that being a bit cold and distant is a part of the national identity. Having problems in poorer countries, does not carry the same stigma of the privileged ones. Because its the norm.

I understand im leaving alot of room for your imagination here, but bare with me. (no, there is no magical point to all this) Lets just say it has been alot, and there has been very little else. I doubt its going to get better. And I am reaching a level of exhaustion that scares me. I admit it, I am weak. Reminding me of that fact, does not help my cause. I know this wont go on for long, its already unbearable and this ship is showing alot of cracks. I hate to speculate. But I wouldnt give myself much more than this year.

I dont want this. Nobody wants to kill themselves. But you will, if you are weak and tired enough. I dont care who you are, everybody looses the war of attrition. And trust me, I have been through so many advice and obvious things right now that I facepalm every time somebody mentions a motivational book or another shrink. Trust me, its the last thing I need. People dont understand when they are being captain obvious, and yet I can not demand that people know the full scope of my situation either. People just underestimate the gravity of certain things.

Some understand this, and can relate, the majority dont. So I dont know what im asking for with all this. Because I dont know what to ask for. Maybe we all are waiting for that special someone. Thats going to fix everything, but you know they dont really exist.

So I dont know what to expect. Im just a guy, reaching out for the last time. (opens another beer and spends another friday drinking alone)

It's all well and good to think of ourselves as unbiased, but I can't think ""outside my depression"" like that. Maybe I don't have the self-awareness or the wherewithal, but it's very easy to believe that you've taken the rational approach. I don't know what was on your list. I don't know what belonged, and what didn't belong there. I don't know you.

But maybe that list can change. Not by pretending your flaws don't exist. By addressing these flaws. I can't promise that you can fix all the problems that you've made in your own head. But everyone changes. No matter how many times you've tried and failed, keep trying. You can change. You do change, and you can change in the right way.

It's tough. Sometimes it seems impossible. A lot of the time, in fact. I've made incredible progress, and I've regressed back into what I was before as easily as anything I've ever done. It sucks. It's a long, arduous process.

I've made the effort to better my life, got a job, tried to make friends, tried multiple antidepressants, but the depression still hasn't gotten better. It's been 6 years now and it still hasn't gotten better. When the fuck does it get better? Because I don't have an unlimited amount of energy to constantly be battling this shit. Everyday I go to work, faking a smile, just trying to get through the day without showing anybody that I'm dying on the inside. Because they don't give a fuck, and why should they? They're not responsible for me or my feelings. So I don't blame them. But when you're surrounded by people living their lives and hanging around friends and laughing, you start to wonder when or if it's even going to happen for you. 

Everyday I get home from work I think about ending my life. I'm tired of the cycle I got myself in. I don't have the energy to fix it. I have no support from family, friends, or a SO. I am playing this shitty game of life completely solo. I cry myself to sleep sometimes because I'm so lonely and I wake up the next day and go to work and act like everything is alright. 

I'm tired of it. I'm just so tired. 

**EDIT: I wrote this post before going to work and I honestly did not expect it to get more than 1 or 2 responses so this was definitely a pleasant surprise. A lot of this was me just mostly venting because this morning I felt particularly shitty. Just knowing that I'm not alone in feeling this way is comforting and I appreciate every single response. And just to clarify, it's not that I think things can't get better, I believe they can, but I do not believe they will always get better no matter what like some people make it out to be. And the general saying is condescending and annoying. I'd rather just someone not say anything at all rather than spew a bullshit saying out and think they helped me in some way. But yeah... just wanted to say thank you to you guys. It means a lot.**

135211,,True,[deleted],,,,"Hmm... I wouldn't say there is *zero* chance you will get better, but I agree you are in a really bad situation. There are things you can do to improve, however, they will seem pointless against the overwhelming misery that is your life. What needs to happen is developing a *long-term perspective*. By this I mean you will be able to improve your life, but it will take a very long time and will seem pointless for most of it. However, even if you take baby steps, eventually you can look back and see you have come a long way. Think of it as looking forward to hindsight.

If you want to try it, I suggest finding the single easiest thing you can do to to improve your life and work on that for a while before introducing another. Don't overwhelm yourself. If you are concerned about your weight, can you make small changes in your diet then maybe exercise a little after you get used to changing your eating habits? For example for the first week, try counting all the calories/fats/sugars you eat. Don't even try cutting anything out, just write it down. The second week, try removing/replacing one bad thing with a good one. Do the same the following week. After a few months of working on your diet, do the same with exercise. Start by picking a time of the day, everyday, and so, like, one sit-up and one push-up. Do that a couple days then add another. Does this make sense? The trick is, **you need to set your goals to be reachable, daily, and remind yourself it's going to take a long, long time to improve, and that it's worth it.**

I wouldn't even worry about school right now, there is time for that later. And you never know when you will meet a friend, so just don't beat yourself up about not having one. It's hard to meet people anyway. I wouldn't write off counseling completely, but only you can decide what is best for you. Also, in an ideal world your family will help you reach your short-term goals, but you might have to go it alone, sorry.

Doing good things daily will slowly strengthen your body and mind. Eventually it will be easier to make bigger changes, faster, and you will see a quicker turnaround on your efforts.

Oh, and about suicide. You see, that's pretty hard to do as you are finding out. It's actually easier to break down your problems into manageable chunks than to kill yourself. Path of least resistance, you know what I mean?

It's like they're taking an ACT exam, have no f*cking clue what the answer is and have begun to guess-and-check.

Then, when you come back and say 'nope, didn't work, everything still sucks,' now you're being 'difficult,' and they aren't trying to help you anymore, they're just throwing shit at you to make you 'shut up.'

I think that depression isn't a cause, it's a symptom; a symptom of society and us, the ones afflicted with it, are just single microcosms of a bigger body.  There is no snake oil pill that will 'cure' us and fix the root of the problem.  To solve the problem at its root requires radical societal change and there is no hope of that ever happening.

I can't speak for the nightmares since I have no experience with that, but for me, it's a general low-mood-24/7-no-ambition-just-want-to-sleep-20-hours-a-day-only-waking-to-eat type of depression.

I do, however, also feel as though I'm on the NON 24-hour circadian rhythm that you speak of.  I can be up for 18 hours, then sleep for 9 or 10.  It makes me sick to see my mom go to bed every single day at 9:00 PM and get up at 5:00 AM even on weekends, holidays, vacations...It's every single day like that.  It's sickening.

I've never been to a doctor because of the exact reasons you've detailed in your post.  They seem like they only want to solve the easy problems that net them the most profit.  Even general practitioners are like this.

Consider this scenario: Two people walk into a doctor's office with the same problem.  He prescribes them the same thing.   Person A comes back worse than before, Person B says he's getting better.  The doctor says 'to hell with Person A, he's a pain in the ass,' and turns his attention to Person B.  Person A just gets random shit thrown at him to make him go away because he's more of a headache than he's worth.  Person B keeps paying the $50 and it's a smooth transaction every time.

They are not the gods they think they are and have too big of egos to admit it even when they know they're not.  And you know some of these doctors sleep so well at night thinking they're contributing to society as some purveyors of God's good will.  ""What did you do today, honey?""  ""Oh, I'm saving lives, day in day out...""  Zzzzzzz. *Proceeds to gets up the next morning, hop in his 2nd daily-driver Lexus and drive back to work the next day.*

I suspect we don't have an 'illness' as we are the *symptom* of a bigger illness: society.

I had an incident with a coworker over a month ago outside of work that gave me a roller coaster of emotions. We hooked up, then he immediately got back with his gf that he told me he was completely over... Anyway, unfortunately it eventually led to my suspension from work last Monday when I snapped. My depression was bad, it was bad before but the incident with my coworker but then it really made it difficult to function. I showed it at work and got irritated and angry easily every time someone told me to cheer up, smile, just be happy for myself. I would have if I could so easily. I eventually really messed up. my boss was asking all my coworkers about my recent habits and she piled a huge list of things against me... No one ever really pulled me aside or questioned or seemed to care. 

I did mess up last Saturday, I did snap. but it was not like I didn't try to explain or change something to prevent it. I really asked my boss to change my schedule because I couldn't handle my feelings around said coworker. It was short of panic attacks/irrational anger when I saw him, anger at myself and self harming even... It just built up. My boss said she understood (as a woman) and gave me ideas to distract me but no change in schedule. It was only a week and she expected I'd make a 180 change, because she then called me in after I snapped on Saturday and said I could no longer work there in that condition, that my coworkers told her I seemed like I just wanted to get fired. But I actually was getting better on my one day I didn't have to work with that guy at work. I enjoyed my work that day... It helped me not feel meaningless. I could have enjoyed it again. 

Anyway, I finally sought treatment. I don't know how to describe the emotions I felt after I was suspended. More worthless than ever ( as if I needed help to feel worthless and a failure ). Disappointed, manic depressed, and just done with it. I shouted at my coworker when I honestly didn't want to. According to the doctor on staff, I yelled profanities. I honestly do not remember saying one profanity. It worries me that I blanked out that bad or they just have that much prejudice against me that they heard wrong. Either way, I found a psychologist and was prescribed medication immediately and I went to my first session today to start some cognitive behavior therapy with a therapist.  

My problem now lies in work... My boss told me I needed time to heal, but there was no date set when I can go back. Or a definite if. She said first I have to sit down with her and my coworker that started it, then the others. My coworker told her what happened, according to her. Which really hurts. It's no ones business that I slept with him, I was always vague that it's personal reasons and that it is my emotions. My brother supported that I went and sought treatment. I'm only on my second day of Prozac and Lamictol, and  I got prescribed something for my anxiety. Some second generation antihistamine, forget the name. Anyway, when I texted him this, he immediately talked about going to my boss. Now he wants me to go and get my job back. But I'm feeling even more anxious, more depressed, and not sure how long I need and he didn't understand that. I don't know if he's right, but what if I try and freak out and lose my one chance at getting my job back? I'm just not ready to face the world and scared still about what the medication is going to do to me. 

This wasn't short at all... But I honestly just need to vent to people that actually may understand what I may be feeling. 

To add to it all, the only friend I have left wants me to meet my coworker outside of work to talk things out. She texted just the other night when they were at a bar together to try to get me out and talk. I took three Benadryl, was passed out, and still freaking out. And she kept repeating that I need to try if I want to fix things. That she can only do so much... She's the closest to know what I may be feeling but still obviously doesn't get it. I couldn't get out of bed all week if my life depended on it, was shaking so bad just going to see the psychiatrist. And she expects me to face this guy that's a real bad trigger to all this. Like talking once will fix it all. It already led to making things worse, since he tried once and then got angry that I didn't just smile and act like nothing happened right away. The more time that passed, the more I work myself into hating him and myself for feeling that way. 

Tl;dr: I doubt this covered half of what I feel and what happened and it's vague but... I suffered long term depression. Over a month ago I slept with coworker... manic depression, anxiety, and anger issues followed me TO work. Suspended from work because I snapped and messed up among everything else  made me even more depressed... Not sure if I can get it back and no one to empathize with my emotions on why I don't want to just jump back. Just started medication, scared how I will react to them, but unsure what to do about my job and life now because my brother says I shouldn't put it on hold but feel I need a break somehow. Wanting to just curl up in bed and disappear. I no longer know what to do next. 

I wish it can all just go back to the night we were all friends, and that I never fell for any lies and slept with him. when I'd be able to be happy at work and sing and just enjoy what I did even if I was lonely and depressed when I got home... At least I had that. ",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,"Suffering for a long time, finally sought help but unsure what to do with my life now. Feel alone in all this.

I posted a picture in my facebook, and it got reported, and Facebook put me on like, social media lock down . They took me out of all of my depression and self harm support groups and blocked any graphic content from my account (kinda like parental control) and now I have a banner across my time line that has a suicide hotline number on it, in case I need it.

For the last few days, people that I thought were my friends have been attacking me left and right. It started with a guy that I was friends with, telling me that because I was drunk and naked in bed with a man, it was my fault that I got raped by him and that I deserved it.

I openly fight for women's rights on my profile, a lot, and suddenly friends that used to fight along side me, are now fighting against me and attacking me.

Last night my mom told me she was concerned for me, but won't tell me why. When I asked why, she somehow turned the entire thing around to make her the victim of me, like I was attacking her. She then proceeded to tell me that while she loves me, she doesn't like me anymore and thinks that my thoughts and what I'm doing with my life are wrong (I'm an artist, looking for a job close to home because I can barely afford gas, and taking commission pieces on the side to help offset bills). She's a very hardcore Christian,  that thinks homosexuality is the biggest sin ever and that mental illnesses are fake and just a way to get attention; if you aren't like her, she sees you as wrong. She then accused me of lying about how my step dad used to abuse me, before he died.

I just feel like I can't take anymore. I'm usually really good about just letting it go, but right now I feel like I'm being crushed under it all. I feel like there's no way out anymore...

37704,,True,[deleted],,,,"This might not be relevant, but I seem to remember Shadow from *American Gods* being a bit of a depressed character. That could just be the way I read into it because I'm pretty sure it never explicitly says anything like that, but in the beginning, he gets out of jail just after (or just before) finding out that his wife had died and was cheating on him with his best friend. (Not really spoiling much- I think it happens within the first 30-40 pages or so.) And something about his reactions throughout the book shows a bit of anhedonia. Maybe he's just more stolid and reluctant than depressed, I can't really remember. I think I read that book 6 years ago, so I might be remembering it differently than it was written. 

Also, I believe Ignatius J. Reilly in *Confederacy of Dunces* was depressed. If he wasn't, he was at least extremely lazy, but since the author, John Kennedy Toole, suffered from depression, and ultimately killed himself, I think there's a dash of depression in Reilly's character. Even then, though, he's a bit of an anti-hero. 

As far as films, I have a fondness for *About Schmidt* because first off, Jack Nicholson plays a character that is vastly different from his over-the-top, egocentric, madman roles. He is muted and uncomfortable, and generally doesn't feel so good about anything. It's more of a coming of age story for an old man who has lost everything and is attempting to start over because rolling over to die seems a *little* less convenient.

All of these might just be my interpretation.

To cut long story short I literally hate every inch of myself. I'm too fat, too tall, too pale. My feet and hands are too big. My thighs are awful, my bum is too small, stomach just doesn't look nice. Hips are too narrow so thighs touch. Boobs are non existent. Face is just bloody awful, the chin, the uneven skin, the big forehead and of course the nose. Not to mention the frizzy dead hair. I hate being so self conscious 24/7 and constant thinking people are talking about how ugly I am. I hate comparing myself to other people constantly. I hate the fact I want to cut myself because it just makes my legs look even worse. But I really couldn't give two fucks about myself, so why do I care if i make myself bleed. Hate the fact I'm terrified of plastic surgery yet I'm going to be forever unhappy with myself unless I get some.
 For the past few years I've photoshopped every photo I've put online. It's got to the point now where I can't bear to look at myself in the direct light, I get dressed and put my makeup on with the curtains closed. 
Before I had a boyfriend I use to sleep with random guys and that would boost my self esteem. But now I don't get that, my boyfriend is the most loving supportive person but he doesn't give me what I could get from meaningless sex with strangers.
 I'm on the waiting list for cbt but in the meantime I don't know what I can do to stop feeling so fucking terrible.

I have come here seeking some advice. 
I was recently diagnosed with depression. I was a heavy drinker and did a lot of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine before recently (about two months ago) giving up the lifestyle of being a party girl. 

I am not completely sober or trying to be, as I still drink (not much though) occasionally, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to how I can overcome the emptiness I feel when sober. I just don't know what to do with myself. I try to stay busy to distract myself from the looming darkness that is my depression, but I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions? 

I was constantly self-medicating before with marijuana and alcohol to suppress negative thoughts, feelings, and depression that would arise when I was sober. I was basically getting blitzed out of my mind so I wouldn't feel so sad. 

Now I don't know what to do with myself because I am re-learning basically everything. I'm re-learning how to socialize and go out without drugs, re-learning how to cope with my emotions, and even re-learning how to date.

Any advice I could get would be helpful. I was wondering if other people suffering from depression have gone through this as well?

For reference, I am in therapy, but I only see my therapist for an hour a week, sometimes two hours, so there is only so much she can help me with. I don't take SSRIs or anything like that as I prefer not to take medication.

I started worrying about how the other person perceived me and whether it was going to work out. I then started thinking about a random time ages ago when I was telling some deep secrets and got panicked about how I was perceived then. This led to some moderate anxiety for an hour or two until that faded and turned into depression.

I'm very aware of what led me into this depressive mood, and if I don't do anything about it it's going to get worse and I'm going to be trapped in it but I can't seem to do anything about it. I'm trying to stop myself indulging in self pity and writing things down to correct irrational thoughts, but it's not really lifting me and I'm not able to completely get out of the loop, especially when I'm not watching my thoughts closely and challenging the negative ones.

Any other good techniques for challening the early stage of depression when it's directly a result of negative thinking?

Still, what'll happen if I drop out? I want to go into zookeeping, which is a pretty competitive field. I have some experience working with animals, which will be a boost, but without a degree... I just don't know.
Add to that my personal situation. For the first time ever, I have a social group that I'm happy with. If I drop out, I don't know if I'll be able to keep that up. I'd have to move away from my college town, and I wouldn't see my friends.
Another problem: parents. What will they think? I've ALWAYS been groomed for college, and told that school is the number one priority. I don't want to disappoint them. they'd want me to move back home, which would be the logical thing to do (it's half an hour away from a major zoo) but I think I'd lose my mind.

Things are going pretty well in my life, but I have no friends and I have a deep, severe, unshakable depression.  Every day I wish it would be better if I were dead (but don't worry, I wouldn't ever kill myself).  

After a particularly painful depressive episode, I decided to finally go see a therapist (I'm 30).  I told her about my lack of friends and my inclination to hole up in my apartment, and she suggested that I have a party at my place for my coworkers.  I thought this was an absurd suggestion; if I were able/willing to do that, why would I even be talking to her?  Should I seek out another therapist to try to find someone with a better understanding of where I'm coming from or give her another chance?  I'm just not sure that she understands what I'm going through, but it was only my first visit so maybe it will just take time for her to understand my social anxiety (which I think is pretty common).

What are your general experiences with therapy?  Like a lot of people here, I think constantly about my depression and research ways to improve it.  Is going to a therapist going to amount to more than I'm doing myself?

* I'm taking too many credits than I'm used to (12.)
* I'm going to drop Physics 211 for now, I felt like I hit a brick wall the minute the professor started talking, even though it has no pre-requisites besides Calculus I
* My Calculus II teacher is different than any other math teacher I've ever had. He implicitly does tricky algebraic functions and makes me feel like I don't know anything, even about Calculus I which I got a B in. There's a huge gap in the Calculus I that I took and the Calculus I that he taught, as he has mentioned a few times ""if you were in my class you'd know that...""
* I've spent 15 hours on Calculus II homework in the past two days, and I still know absolutely nothing new. I cried after class today, because I can't remember the math from the previous term and keep making mistakes, let alone that it's on new material.
* Every day this week so far I've woke up and just wanted to disappear, and when sitting in class with everything going over my head I just want to die, and then after class I drive home in a silent car and can't get the strength to get out after I park.
* I've been looking for a job for a while, and finally got a telephone call about an interview this morning. I called back and left a message to let them know what times I was available, thinking that they wanted to call me back to set up a time. I was wrong though, listening to the message again it was obvious that they just wanted me to come in, but it's too late now for today and I'm not free until Friday. I feel like a huge idiot. They've probably been waiting for me to drop in this whole time, I don't want to try and think about how this might affect my chances.

I have always had problems with depression, but this week has made it exponentially worse. I have intruding thoughts every once and a while, but they keep coming up several times throughout the day now. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow, but until then I still feel like a complete and utter failure. If I lose the chance for that interview I'm going to be heartbroken.

I'm extremely harsh on myself when something goes wrong, no one around me has done anything to make me feel this way. I make myself feel this way and I cannot stop it from happening. I worked solo in Calculus I last term, even for the group projects. I'm too embarrassed to make a mistake that is probably fairly simple at this level, and I don't do social contact either besides a very very small amount of people. I was incredibly proud of the B I earned because I did it all on my own with tens of YouTube videos and Khan Academy. 

Now it all comes crashing down on me and I have no idea what to do. I feel like I'm always on an uphill battle, I barely passed high school and was really happy to get the dean's list two terms in a row in college, but now it's starting to slip away from me.

&gt;**Major depressive disorder** (**MDD**) (also known as **clinical depression**, **major depression**, **unipolar depression**, or **unipolar disorder**; or as **recurrent depression** in the case of repeated episodes) is a [mental disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) characterized by a pervasive and persistent [low mood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood\)) that is accompanied by low [self-esteem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem) and by a [loss of interest or pleasure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia) in normally enjoyable activities. This cluster of symptoms ([syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome)) was named, described and classified as one of the [mood disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder) in the 1980 edition of the [American Psychiatric Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association)'s [diagnostic manual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders). The term ""depression"" is ambiguous. It is often used to denote this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or to lower mood states lacking [clinical significance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance). Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit [suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide), and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder.

I experienced very extreme sexual repression during my formative years and it caused me to retreat from normal life. After a few events that compounded my condition, I became obsessed with the pursuit of purity. No sex, no drugs, no drinking; and virtually no contact with anyone who engaged in behavior that I deemed ""impure"". For a couple of years, I would say I was pretty much straight-jacket worthy. 

I went off to catholic college to please my parents because I thought that's what they wanted from me. A place with little or no party scene where I could concentrate on becoming ""successful"" or whatever the fuck that means. I've never lived a day in my life for myself and I now I'm 22 with no direction and no goals.

In fact, I've never had a goal in my life. I've never aspired to be anything. I can't help thinking that my upbringing is the cause of who I am today and what path I'm on.

Since being at college, I've had 2 women in my life. The first lasted about 9 months during which we never made it past first base. She had been raised just like I had been raised. I guess I should have expected that. The second girl was from home and she was the complete opposite of everything I had ever known. Incredibly oversexualized, loud, extroverted. I was finally having sex. And then it was over about 2 months later.

Before losing my virginity, I would constantly be haunted by the word: virgin. As soon as I woke up in the morning, the first thing that went through my mind was ""oh my god, I'm still a virgin"". Now it's ""oh my god, I've only had sex with 1 girl"". I know this all sounds absurd...but when sex is the only thing that you feel you can't have, sex becomes the only thing that you want.

I haven't let myself go. I'm in a really good shape, I'm a great musician, and I'm about to graduate college. On the surface, I look like I really have my shit together. But socializing is still really hard. Especially when it comes to talking to girls. I've lost nearly all motivation for getting a girlfriend. And since having a girl in my life is the only thing that makes me happy, I'm depressed all the time. **I've always thought that since I'm situationally depressed, that it's not really depression but now I'm not so sure.** I should note that depression does run in my family on both sides.

I've been in therapy for 3 years, but at this point I feel like it's just a crutch. I feel good during the session when I'm getting things off my chest but then it all comes crashing down the next day. I can't live like this anymore. I've been fantasizing about suicide for nearly a decade. I could never follow through though.

The reasons I've been hesitant to take anti-depressants are as follows:

* 
I'm afraid I'll become complacent with my current situation and therefore I'll just be a zombie that can't feel sadness but doesn't make any real positive changes.

* 
I'm afraid that I'll lose my libido and 1. Not be able to perform with future girlfriends or 2. My motivation for meeting someone will completely vanish with my decreased libido.

* 
I'll feel spaced out. I remember one redditor saying that Prozac gave him ""brain fog"" and made it difficult for him to concentrate on things.

* I'm ashamed to confront my parents about this but I'm on their health plan so I don't know if I can avoid them finding out that I'm on anti-depressants.

There's many times during the day where I just don't care anymore.  About anything.  I don't care.  I don't want to care.  I want to just sit and stare into nothing and wait for the world to come to an end so everything can be over.  I have to put on a silly serious face when talking to people like I can about what they're saying.  I often daze out thinking about something else while keeping an ear to their chatter, then just agree with what they've said, whatever the hell it was, when they stop talking.

I think about death a lot.

  I want to be gone from here sometimes.  Not always, but often enough that it has been ingrained into my daily thoughts.

I think about my dad laying in the hospital bed mentally dead but his body living with machines.  No consciousness whatsoever.  Fucking kills me every time.  Like I can see his vapid eyes on his face, even though his lids are closed, a machine pumping air into his lungs keeping him 'alive', at that point, there was no alive.  Brain dead.  Dead.

There is an Employee Assistance Program, I haven't called it.  I want to, but don't.  I feel guilty for not doing so, and will feel guilty for wanting to and doing it, if or when I do.

I'm seeing a doctor on Wednesday and will bring this all up.  I hope I do.

It's been two minutes and I'm over this self loathing, I'm not currently severely depressed.  I think, just by chance that I may have a brain tumor or some kind of cancer which effects my thought process.  I don't really understand it, but the symptoms I've been having lately, mostly behind and above my eyes, left temple pain, but not so severe that it will put me down for some time, but enough where I have to stop walking/talking/moving and let it subside.

Have just had a thought of myself behind myself taking my head and smashing it into the desk wood several times.

I feel like I blank out often during the day.

My face often feels like it will explode outwards; **[**to puke out blood everywhere, usually in a downward motion, sometimes from third person.  Most notably if my whole face itself was a mouth, but not in the literal aspect, such that my face itself becomes a water hose and spews blood.**]**

My vision will be blurry one minute and more than crystal clear the next.

I feel sometimes that I am more more myself if everything else is silenced when I've had beer.  Not an abnormal amount as I can still hold a conversation, walk normally, concentrate, nothing is really abnormally funny when it shouldn't be.

I want to destroy something, I want to let loose and remove all the hurt, the pain, the *frustration*.  I want to know the **GODDAMN PROBLEM**.

You don't seek out help ""to go get anti-depressants"". You seek out help, and they help you. Yes, they might (probably will) prescribe you anti-depressants, but they might not. They might find you haven't been eating right, or sleeping right, or you have dips in blood-sugar, or you're part vampire and the sun makes you depressed. 

If its a chemical imbalance, they probably ***will not*** be able to tell you just by blood work. It possible, and you should have blood work done, but it usually doesn't help. 

If you are feeling suicidal, you don't have a good handle on whats going on. You might be right that you're just genetically predisposed to depression, but you might not be. The point is, you need help in the form of a person or people, not just in the form of a pill. 

When you go to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor, its important to find the right match. Some you will click with, some you might not. Please don't write off the experience if you find that the first person you went to see wasn't helpful to you. Now, to your questions...

1: You normally do not need a referral from a GP to see a psychiatrist, though you may need a referral from a GP of psychiatrist to see a psychologist or counselor. Ask your insurance company. Also, ask your insurance for a list of psych's in your area that are fully covered.

2: In my experience, psychologists are usually more helpful than psychiatrists. Even when you think you have a good handle on things. They can help find places that still need improvement. Even when you do have a handle on things, they offer judgment free, positive support, which can be hard to find when depression feels embarrassing.

3: I'm on anti-depressants. It's going well. They didn't magicly make things better, but they made it so I felt like I could get a handle on my life. I actually just stopped them for a while and restarted. In my case, they made me care about my life a lot more, plain and simple. The first meds I used worked, but we had to go to the absolute max dosage, which took some time. Other people I know have been through 10 medicines before finding one that fit them. 

Also, if you end up on meds, please see a mental health pro regularly as you start them. They can make you feel more suicidal, as you probably know. More over, they can make your body feel better before your mind catches up. This can lead you to make some bad decisions you wouldn't normally make, so its important to stay in contact with people as you begin taking them.

Hope this helped.

I want to prepare whoever is reading this. This post is more than anything, to allow me to vent. My thought's may be jumbled, my questions may be rhetorical, and my story will be long. That being said, I am a fifteen year old male sophomore. My parents  have been divorced since I was one. I make good grades and take advanced courses, have a girlfriend, and maintain a steady friendship with three or four other kids my age. I don't have some messed up history of abuse or trauma. 

My parents have fought up until a couple years ago. No more than I suppose would be normal after a divorce. They couldn't stand each other. And the made it very clear. There was no physical violence to speak of. Only yelling and raw emotions swirling around in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle. Visitation was split in favor of my mother. I spent every other weekend and every Thursday with my father. 

As I grew older, I became more involved in the arguments of my parents. Not by choice. Neither of them wished to communicate with one another. I was the messenger. And over the years, they kept shooting holes in me. As the arguments stacked, I slowly began to blame myself more and more for their fighting and there divorce. My father was often busy with work, trying to do what he could to support us. My mother did not work. Instead she and I were supported quite generously by my grandfather. My father was also a rule stickler. My mother essentially let me do as I pleased. The rare moments that I spent with my dad early on were often accompanied with misbehavior which he corrected swiftly with punishment. My mom made no effort to do so. So I started to view my father negatively and think of him as overly strict. 

While I was in first grade, I ended up spending a good portion of my waking hours in the school's aftercare system. One day, while play fighting with another student, I ended up hitting him with my school belt. It was a strike that couldn't have left more than a small bruise, but it was enough to get me in trouble. For reasons that I now can only attribute to my pent-up emotions and self-blame, I had a meltdown. Among many other things that I said during my emotional release, I told the teacher that I hated my father and wanted to commit suicide. A friend of the teacher who had been standing in the room had an occupation involving or at least related to the civil court. Although my comment was offhand and untrue, the words had been said. My parents ended up in court once again and I spent a summer without seeing my father. Visitation was resumed as normal with a counselor in the room at all time for the following six months. I also began to see a therapist in order to discuss my suicidal thoughts. 

Slowly, I began to convince myself of the lie I told until I truly did hate my father. I learned from that situation that it was better to keep my emotions locked away. I blamed myself more and more until I had determined I was a burden to everyone around me and that I would be better off dead. I tried to strangle, suffocate, hang, drown, and stab myself multiple times, only to lose the nerve at the last second. I continued to see new therapists over the years, for a total of five separate ones, none of which helped. It wasn't their fault though. I just never let them help. I didn't tell them things as they really were. 

About three years ago, I realized the mistake I had made and tried to improve my relationship with my father as best as I could. New work changes allowed us to spend more time together. He had also gotten remarried and ended up having another child with my stepmother. His redirection of attention towards my sister and stepmother probably gave me the time to quit overreacting and realize what a mistake I had made. 

My mother had spent a good deal of time drinking away her problems while all this was happening. Nearly every night, I'd be left to console her as she cried or stand and listen to her berate me about something that was often not even real. She would also discuss her hatred for my father, her hatred for her father, as well as her childhood trauma from experiencing rape and molestation. In her defense, she legitimately faces depression and other medical issues that affect mood. As of last year, I told my mother that the drinking was too much for me and I couldn't keep doing this nightly routine of fighting and crying. So I started living with my dad for a while, seeing her as I felt like and allowing her to deal with her own personal issues. 

Throughout my entire academic career and continuing on at the present, I put on a ""mask"" around anyone in order to best please them. I try my hardest to make people happy so that I feel like less of a burden to them. Or at least so I feel like I make up for it. I listen to their problems and then feel worse for caring about mine since it seems that everyone has it far worse than I do. And I say that without sarcasm. I spend most of my days wondering what the meaning is to my life. I have decided that my life has no meaning. I would kill myself but I don't want to hurt those who I'd leave behind and I don't want to worry about the pain or the effort it would take. 

I don't know who I really am anymore because I've lost  myself behind all the masks. I don't know if I care about anything or anyone, or if I just lie to myself to make it so I feel like I'm normal. Or maybe I am normal and tell myself I'm not so I can feel bad about it. In one of the top posts in this subreddit, the op mentioned that he didn't want to kill himself. He just wanted everything to stop or go away. He wanted to be calm. I feel like everything that I see is burdened by my presence and I feel terrible for it. I think about it and just feel worse and worse. I shove myself into a corner where I'm surrounded by reminders of all the people that I affect daily. And each one tells me that I made that person's day slightly worse. To anyone who is reading this, you are one of those people. You are someone who was burdened. You had to think about my problems. You had to sit and read this long jumbled post about someone whose life is most probably perfectly fine. Someone that is just whining about their insignificant problems. I don't what I was asking when I posted this. I don't know what answers I expected. But I vented. I feel bad for making people listen, but good for saying it.

&gt; The other thing I want to tell you is that 90% of these interactions are driven by attitude, so what you're thinking at the time is just as important as how you look and dress

I just wanted to make it clear that I'm not always in a state of depression. Sure, when my anxiety gets the best of me, or I'm trying to make friends/bond with current ""friends"" and they all ignore me and flock to my sister, I'm reminded of how awkward I am in comparison. How unliked I am by friends and strangers alike, and I'll beat myself up about it (hence, the depression.) But usually I'm willing to try to have a ""normal"" conversation, learn and get better. That's what's in my head during interactions, but I always feel nervous deep down and struggle to find things to say. 

&gt; Yes, a total slob isn't going to score the gorgeous counterpart outside of a hollywood movie; that being said, the range of possibilities is much wider than you think. 

I'm not sure I understand. Can you elaborate?

Anyway, I could totally use some tips/advice about how to be more likable. So far I'm thinking about 

- trying to find new friends (maybe clubs/hobby groups) and never letting them meet or hang out with my sister.

- accepting that I'll never really be liked by people, and just stop trying. Basically, just take my place as a nobody in my own life. A background character/after thought to those around me.

- abandoning anyone (friends/acquaintances included) who treat me badly/ignore me or prefer my sister over me

- telling my sister to stop talking over me in group conversations, and stop treating me in a way I don't like when we're in public/trying to take my friends from me (i don't know if i have the guts to do this though)

Any of these sound good to you? Also, any tips on getting out of depression? thanks",,0.0,,2012-09-23 07:00:00,,,0,1348380343,,,,0,,c6c4q1b,,,,,t3_10bvc9,,,t1_c6c4q1b,,,,t1_c6c4fkm,,,,,,,,1429967685.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

I'm generally an easy going guy. I'm happy and don't usually think bad thoughts about myself. I enjoy my life for the most part and do not complain much (my opinion) 

Before my wife,kid, and I moved from Southern CA away from our friends, no one seemed to care really. All my friends I grew up with all do their own thing and stopped inviting me places. We had a going away party that only a few showed up to and they never text or call me. Now I know that friends come and they go but I'm worried my friends of 10+ years just don't want to say that they don't care about me. 



Sometimes I think about ending it. Like everything would be easier if I didn't have to deal with it all. Bill collectors, work, fights with Wife, kid stressing me out, etc. Life really. 



I've read about depression and how you can be fighting depression while seeming happy or seeming like you're not sad all the time. I'm curious if I am fighting depression? Should I be concerned? Should I look into help of some sort? Maybe see a shrink and see if they think I have issues? 



I honestly think and hope I don't have depression or any mental issues because my wife and daughter need a father and husband that is there for them.

Being single is alright. Work on being stable before incorporating someone else into your life. It'll give the relationship a much more stable foundation and improve the chances of it being long lasting, healthy, and successful.

I've been practicing meditating recently.

OK, it's a bit chaotic, sorry also add/adhd over here and I need to stop writing at some point and take a step back and look at what I just managed to hammer in.

Depressions suck, especially for loved ones as they see that someone is struggling and they try to reason and come up with solutions, without realizing that the person they are talking to are broken.

And broken means, literally broken, we have a different perception on situations and are lacking in emotions and/ or are overwhelmed by feelings of sorrow, grieve, misery and/ or shame.

Also on average we get more stupid, as the gears start slowing down, they way you handle information and process it is also affected.

This can add to the feeling of anxiety and despair, just imagine watching your favorite series and you can't laugh when something is funny, hell you can't even follow the plot or grasp what someone just said.

I think someone posted a link in this subreddit a few day's ago to a long post from someone working on a suicide hotline on how to talk to people who are really down.

All you can do basically is to try and sympathize, because nothing is more depressing that hearing someone say things like: 'Others have it way tougher' etc. 

As these are the thing the person also knows, however that knowledge doesn't seem to affect how you feel, making you feel ever more frustrated and depressed about yourself.

You can only try and ask if you can help with certain things, while hoping for the best.

In my case, due to the nature of the relationship (long distance, career)
and all that went down, we split up and tried to be friends as I wasn't able to get my career or study going.

And in the case of things getting really bad(losing income, no housing etc. ) you should just ask him how he thinks that should be dealt with.

Give him a chance to give room to the fact that he probably won't be able to do certain things at the moment and that he could use some help from people around him to perhaps guide or make decisions for him.

Just try and support him as best as you could, looking out for things that can help him, like healthy food, some exercise.

And sunlight is also important because of your biological clock, which tends to suffer badly in efficiency during a depression, sleeping long and late as you mentioned.
 
Also try to get him outside, have a change of scenery.

Go for a walk in the woods if you have them nearby or grab a coffee in a quiet bar near a lake, you get the idea I hope.

And in the end, we all have to live our own lives.

Sometimes with a companion, sometimes on your own.

I'm not a psychologist and so I can't help you with your various conditions as much as I wish I could attempt and amateur diagnosis, it would be wrong. What you could try is changing your councillors, when I had one for my depression he was a great help. So of you can change, it may be worth looking in to (I don't know how easy that is, sorry). And I can't help but think that if you can get help sorted especially for the hyperactive brain problem, then everything else will lighten too.

Through the last year and a bit I've come to the conclusion that it's a mixture of genetics (one of my parents has had many depressive episodes) and my upbringing (very distant). Unfortunately with this knowledge we don't find out how to 'stop' it.

As with what to do. It's tricky, I assume you've seen a doctor and you've officialy been diagnosed?

Otherwise, it's hard to speak to people like psychologists, but it can be helpful, as well as this, if you aren't already, you may be put on some anti-depressants which could lift your mood a bit. Another thing I always suggest finding support groups for this kind of thing. The one I've been going to for about half a year is filled with people who can relate, but who also have their own unique problems, which means talking, listening and helping others can bring so many benefits, as well as people who understand you and how you feel, I found this so helpful.",,0.0,,2013-06-20 22:40:20,,,0,False,,,,0,,camylmr,,,,,t3_1gr5iu,,,t1_camylmr,,,,t3_1gr5iu,,,,,,,,1430739869.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

253125,,True,ertihan,,,,"Hmm.  Well, I will say I envy you.  Because you have a friend who, from all appearances, genuinely cares.  She cares enough that she'd stick around even after you've informed her of your depression, and how serious it is.  She doesn't cut you off, or run away, or claim it's ""too much to handle"".  As hopefully you can tell from how I am speaking, I've had a friend - my closest in fact - do exactly that to me.  If you think it's tough to have a friend who ask you ""that"" way how you are, imagine having someone you've opened up to, the person you thought was your best friend in the whole world, slam the door right in your face.

I'm not saying you're a bad person for not taking that into consideration or something trite like that.  You're depressed, just like the rest of us, and when you're in that state, it's very easy to just think of yourself.  One of the issues I was dealing with was depression so severe that I wanted to commit suicide - when *my* best friend heard that, she berated me.  Told me, ""how dare you, do you know how that made me feel?!""  While I was sitting there thinking, ""Lady!  I almost killed myself!  How *you* felt?!  What about ME?!!!""

In 20/20 hindsight, of course, it is obvious she only said that because she DID care, but at the time I wasn't exactly in the right mind to properly process that.  But it's easy to be wise after the fact.  In the end she turned out not to be a particularly great friend - she couldn't handle my ""selfishness"" apparently.  But it seems your friend is a better person than that.  She understands that in your current state, you can't always think of others, you've gotta get yourself handled first.  And that's a rare and precious thing.

I mean, she even did research on something she thought might help you.  I think that says a lot.  Look, in the end I don't know what may or may not work for you.  Every person is different, so, maybe for you it'll be medication, or therapy, or possibly just finding that one thing you're passionate about.  I do wonder though, do you ever do any sort of fiction writing?  Given your skill with the written word, I'm quite sure you could be an excellent author, and I've found writing to sometimes be a good escape.

If you're not particularly keen on writing by yourself - goodness knows I hate it - I'd be happy to do some sort of collaborative writing with you if that's at all interesting to you.  An escape, of course, is not a cure.  I've learned that the hard way.  You can escape all you want into your own fantasy world, but once the typing stops, the real world slams its ugly head right back in.  But... but it does make life just that little bit more tolerable.  For a few minutes, at least, you're somewhere else.  You're someONE else.

So I thought I'd make a list of those people, because I'm spending my time between three things at the moment: Trying to forget I can't talk to anyone, experiencing large amounts of emotion because I can't talk to anyone, wanting to talk to someone about the fact that I can't talk to anyone, and talking to people and promptly realizing why I have not been. So, I made a list under the false pretense of remembering who they were and what they did, and more to make myself more depressed.

And since I have no one to talk to, I have no one to share my list of deep pain with.

So here you are reddit.

People you shouldn't talk to about your personal biz, and the reasons why:

- Janice: Looks down on people who don't go to school HER way and to HER college and follow HER classes, thinks people who lives different lifestyles are essentially retarded, mocks people different than her frequently and behind their backs.

- Mary: She's said she can't handle talking about stuff, even though that's what the friendship was built on. Doesn't know how to debate if issues actually come up, will leave for hours without explanation, doesn't like confrontation or discussion at all, will get mad and make the issue about you, etc etc it's a not fun. And you'll stress out even worse just don't do it. Don't go there.

- Dan: Immediately changed subject to Tom, is hard to figure out, sometimes replies funny... he's Dan.

- Sasha: She'll say she cares and then you'll desperately cling to her every word while she doesn't respond to your texts or when she does she either completely ignores what you said and say something else, or respond completely inadequately. And you'll hurt more than any of the others because she actually does care, but she can't be there, or, when she doesn't care and you wish she did.

- Shaundra: It was very nice of her to be your friend and then decide she wanted to talk to someone else and tell you you weren't trying hard enough at life

- Megan : Very nice of HER to befriend you, make you feel you had a companion in depression, and then tell you later that you should try to ""be happier"" and that you're not trying hard enough to get better. It's weird how she changed so suddenly from seemingly understanding everything to nothing at all. Like her brain got wiped.

- Hannah: Megans friend, did the same as megan. But she apologized after reading a book on depression, so she *gets it now*.

- Irena: Stopped talking to as soon as she found out you weren't attracted to her. Didn't really see the need to pursue friendship further.

- BandXa: Randomly disappeared, reappeared, than disappeared, than reappeared, than said she'd not leave again, shortly before leaving.

- Jo: Posted some pretty mean shit, and also she doesn't really talk even when she talks.

- Danni: Doesn't really know what to say/do, and when she tries she's not very good at it.

- Ansakse: If Danni has no idea what to know, Ansakse has a complete absence of idea. Oh god.

- Aura67: She had to go

- Becca: Seems helpful but than what she says isn't really.

- Susan_strong: Seems helpful and is but than when you think she's helping she goes off somewhere that doesn't really help

- Tali: oblivious about everything

- Ada : likes to deviate the conversation

- ~Aussies: doesn't know what to say, also it's been more than half a fucking year since she even deigned to talk to you

- Baley: ""You need to talk to me more""

- Xena: She found someone else to talk to

- oldschoolbestie: Yeah, I'm sure she'll get to that message you sent her very soon! She's just been busy XD

- Tom: He'll nod and say mm-hmm and sound very deep in thought and interested... and then talk about how much everything sucks for him.

- Food_propeller: He'll make you feel he cares and get you hooked to talking to him, then he'll leave in the middle of the convo inexplicably and then return five hours later, at which point he will reply and say something completely useless.

[end list]

--

An additional fantastic piece of irony on this particular debacle is that recently I've been operating between two states: would rather talk to strangers (cause they don't already know my biz so I feel more comfortable) or Would rather talk to friends (cause i feel really hurt inside and need someone to talk to and sorta help me). I was feeling a lot of would rather talk to strangers because of my friends stuff, so I reached out on reddit to maybe find some people to talk to to help. However, shortly after making that post (and actually receiving replies, most of my calls for help have been met with rather emotion-withering silence) I switched to preferring to talk to friends... of which I had none. So I continue my downward spiral.

Anyway. Thanks for reading all this junk. I hope a person or two does, because while I say that I know a lot of posts say that and get tons of replies, I'm kinda nervous cause I'm putting all this out here, and that takes energy... that I don't really have. So if no one replies here... it'll have taken a lot out of me for not much. Ehh. So it'd be good.

I, like a lot of the posters I've seen in this subreddit, am having an existentialist crisis of sorts.

Quick back story of sorts:
Growing up I was always very passionate about a history. I loved to talk about it, study it, and it was pretty much what I spent the majority of my idle time thinking about. I went to college to get a degree in it, but my senior year I lost my passion for it.

It was during that senior year that my life started crumbling. I was in a relationship with a girl for three years and the relationship had taken on an emotionally abusive aspect over the previous year. At this point it was starting to collapse, along with all my plans for the future. At the same time I was about to graduate straight into a massive recession with 0 job prospects, while being forced to move several states away, losing all my networked connections and friends. Oh, and on my graduation day I found out my last and favorite grandmother was dying of cancer. 

I almost committed suicide when we moved to the middle of BFE, but didn't. The thing that did die, however, was my passion for history, for all the things I loved, for life. 

In the middle of this all I was developing an anti-passion. I say ""anti-passion"" because I associate a ""passion"" with something positive, something you enjoy talking about, something that you get excited about. My anti-passion was just the opposite. It was a rage, a rage mainly about politics, but also about just life in general. Like a passion I thought about it almost constantly, but unlike a passion it just made me furious and combative.

All I did was listen to the news and religious/political podcasts over and over again. It was like sitting in a soundproof room and blasting a stereo. The signals just bounced off the walls, echoed, and overwhelmed me. One day I had an epiphany and realized how toxic of an environment I was living in, how toxic my anti-passion had become. I shut off the stereo and went outside. 

While this has helped me come out of my toxic phase, I lost my faith in humanity, justice, and the future in the process. This loss has continued to haunt me and is keeping me from moving forward. I don't want to get bogged down in trying to explain *why* I lost faith in humanity and the future. It was for a variety of reasons, but I'll just say that after immersing myself like that in so much news from around the world for such a long period of time, I started to see patterns and trends in human behavior, patterns and trends that were really ugly.  I also came to realize that the notion of ""slow but steady progress towards a better tomorrow"" was nothing but a comforting lie people tell themselves in the face of so much bigotry, injustice, and suffering. 

I was, am, an utter cynic about everything. I've been trying to get into zen as a way of letting it all go, but to be honest, I haven't been very successful. 

You see, with this extremely grim outlook on life and with no hope for tomorrow, I find it very difficult to find love. I can't fall in love with a field that I could make a career out of if I think it's all pointless in the end. I've been struggling to regain passion for about three years now and I really feel like I'm running out of time. I'm getting older. I need to find something and focus on it so I can have some marketable skills. 

I feel like my salvation (for lack of a better word) lies in scale. I keep looking at the burning forest and ignoring the beautiful trees in front of me. If I can find something smaller that I feel makes a difference, then maybe I can find love and passion again. The hard part is convincing myself of that. I keep trying to focus on smaller things, but I still can't get the burning forest out of my head!

Sorry if that was a bit ramblely. I just needed to get that off my chest.

**TL;DR**: Lost faith in humanity/justice/the future, can't find passion because it's all ultimately fucked. ",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,"Trying to find passion, but first I must find meaning.",1,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18usj5/trying_to_find_passion_but_first_i_must_find/,

I totally empathize with your frustration. From my research and experience with various drugs I've come to the conclusion that there is a shit load of unknown and that no drug will effect  two people the same way. Moreover, for some people it will have a huge effect and for others none at all. You need to be patient and realize that treating psychological problems with chemicals is still relatively new. Doctors are trying their best but it's practically the Stone Age. Try not to give up but certainly do look out for your best interests. If you think a drug is making you worse, don't blindly accept you should take it but do seek other options.

I'm responding to this because you remind me of my son and what we're going through and I want you to know that people truly, truly care about you.

When I had my first child, I told his dad that I was SUPER worried about when he would turn 14 or 15 and that I desperately hoped he wouldn't have the same horrible depression I did.  But he does.

My son is 14 as well now, has MAJOR ADHD (was on medication from 2nd grade until 5th grade), possible Aspergers (my youngest, 8yr old, has PDD-NOS, a spectrum disorder).  When I was little they said I was ""hyperactivity due to sugar"" but I NEVER had sugar and I was still a mess.  I was obviously misdiagnosed ADHD (just born at a time when they didn't really know what it was, and thought girls never had it).  Anyway... when I was 15 I was put into a treatment facility for depression. 

I still struggle with depression to this day.  I'm in recovery for alcohol and drug use (those of us with depression issues REALLY shouldn't drink or do drugs - they seem like a good way to fix the problem and then become a bigger problem).  I know that depression is the core problem. And now I'm trying to help my son deal with this.

What I can say with absolutely certainty is that those bad days might be memorable and terrible, but the good days will outnumber those exponentially in your life.  GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE to see that to be the truth.  Middle school and High school sucks for MOST people.  You seem like an intelligent kid  - College is where you will meet MANY more people like you and you will make more friends.  When you get your job out of college, you will make more friends.  You will not be alone in life, even if it feels like you are now.  There will be amazing times ahead for you.  Simply know that as truth, and look forward to those times.  They WILL come.

You are cared for, wanted and NOT alone.  I only hope I can convey these things to my own son.  Hope you feel better!!!",,0.0,,2014-05-22 20:08:06,,,0,False,,,,0,,chomeh3,,,,,t3_268alb,,,t1_chomeh3,,,,t3_268alb,,,,,,,,1433911601.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

171974,,True,[deleted],,,,"Here's how I've come to see it:

If you have the will to force yourself to start doing things like keeping to a schedule, even if that schedule is only basic daily things (I know that simple things like showering are suddenly impossible tasks, but if you have the mindset that you have to do it as part of your day's structure, it gets slightly easier.)  Having a list of things to do like this, and then being able to cross them off, helps give a sense of accomplishment, which will lead to doing more things - exercise, hobbies, school, job, whatever.  You have to take baby steps, but eventually that is the goal.  

If you're to the point where you can't make yourself do things then you might want to consider professional help.  A lot of really great suggestions for dealing with depression are dependent on having at least a small bit of motivation to try to make things better, but if you don't have that, then it helps to try something that can give you a boost.  For me, it was starting meds.  For some people, it could be therapy.  For others, vitamins.

Only recently have I made any real headway, however, most of the five years being spent really on crafting the psychological state to get to where I am now.  And I still slip.  All the time.  Most recently was Tuesday.

My story's long, so I'll just tell you the relevant bit.  Over the last year my Mom and I have literally been so drained that we haven't even been able to clean the house.  Like the stuff you see on Hoarders.  I started the long process of getting everything nice and clean on Sunday.  Monday was spent formulating a plan of attack for cleaning the rest of the house.  Tuesday was one of those 'Fuck it,' days, where I couldn't be bothered to do anything but sit at the computer and watch videos/play games.

Everyone copes differently, and sometimes, just getting it out there helps.  But if you're in that state where even your own thoughts are against you, then what I like to do is take a walk.  Especially at night, since that's my favorite time of the day.  I like to find someplace high and just look out at the city lights.  It helps calm my mind.  Finding your peaceful 'place' is always a great way to help you clear the clutter from your mind, and it helps you to maintain a solution-oriented outlook.

And what's 'normal' is subjective.  What matters isn't that you're normal, it's that you are bettering yourself.  Anyone would agree that that's worthy of respect, admiration, and love.  So keep at it.

I locked myself up in my room, skipped school and only went home for the weekends. It made me suicidal, lonely and full of anxiety.

Three weeks ago I got home, stopped going to school and everything got worse. Dysfunctional home, parents making fun of me and suicidal/self-harm ideation shooting through the roof. Felt like puking when I looked in the mirror, and even tried running away from home... just so my mother would stop calling me a ""loser"" and a ""failure"". 

Visited my psychiatrist yesterday, and he basically told me that I have anxiety issues due to a mild autism, and that I was NOT depressed. This got me angry, and sad, because he didn't listen to me! I spend 90 minutes in his office and from the very first minute he jumped on the idea of me having Autism and ignored EVERYTHING I told him. He didn't ask me whether I had suicidal tendencies, and he din't even make me take a Depression test (Goldberg, for example) after I told him I thought I was depressed. Even though I took an AQ test and got a very low score (12) which should basically rule out Autism...

Since yesterday my mother is making fun of my ""autism""... and it made me feel horrible. But now it's gone. My depression that is. I feel a bubbling sense of enthousiam in my chest and my eyes, legs and arms still feel tired and weak, but for some reason I'm happier than I've been in months, even though things just got worse.

I've had this before... I remember spending three days in Camp last year and finally feeling accepted by my classmates. I felt so extremely happy. When I got home I cried for hours, because I KNEW that everything would go back to how it was after the weekend. When I stopped crying I was as sad, and as depressed as ever. 
I'm now going through the exact opposite, except there's no reason for me to suddenly feel enthousiastic.

 The thing that has helped me personally is lowering my caffeine intake. I used to think caffeine didn't affect me and it's true that it doesn't affect me like it does a lot of people, but what it did was keep me awake even if I felt tired. Obviously I don't know if this applies to you, but by forcing myself to only drink caffeine in the begining part of the day, and even then, only having enough to prevent caffeine headaches, I had a lot more success with this. Also keep in mind that I am able to fall asleep even if I was drinking soda all night long, so I used to not believe people who told me to stop caffeine because I was ABLE to fall asleep with it. But not I realize that the nights I couldn't were because of that.

I also have to force myself to go to bed. I have to force myself to stop watching tv or playing games or whatever I'm doing and get into bed with no distraction. If after 20 minutes I'm still awake, I just get back up and try again in a few hours, but lately that hasn't been happening with the 6am wake up.

And with the 6am wake up, it takes 4 separate alarms and two phone calls from my dad to get me up, so it definitely isn't easy. Usually takes me 40 minutes to get up.

**Background:**

Ex-heroin addict, been clean for over a year now with the help of methadone. Originally thought my drug abuse was the cause of my diagnosed clinical depression, so I sought help with methadone. I definitely feel better without the drug addiction, however, the depression hasn't gone completely.

Saw therapists, counselors and a psychiatrist. The latter did nothing more than prescribe me the anti-depressant ""Effexor XR"", telling me that basically this is my one and only cure. If that didn't help me, then I'm not trying hard enough. I've tried everything that was supposed to help me, which included exercise, getting a job, socialising more (read: Get off the computer/TV), and getting out of the house for hobbies/extracurricular activities. 

**My active attempts to help my depression:**

I go to the gym religiously, which I felt helped me at first. I do admit that I'm in a much better shape physically, and that having goals helped put my mind in a better place, but it hasn't cured me psychologically. Within the last few months, I've felt that my depression has started to worsen again.

I got a job. I used to be in I.T. as a technician/tech support, but due to my drug addiction which left me unemployed and then spending a long time away from the industry, hasn't left me with a good foundation of work history. So I've resorted to just do any factory type work I can find. I'm in my third month of my latest job in a foam products production factory.

Now, working to solve my depression was one thing that I felt wouldn't help me, when it was suggested it would, though I did try. The psych told me that maybe I wasn't applying myself enough, which is bullshit. It's not like I'm actively trying to prove him wrong. I've tried to make new friends at work, but to be honest, my depression seemed to have robbed me of my once upbeat personality. These days, I feel, that I just don't know how to socialise with people anymore. Because of this, I've found that people are starting to distance themselves from me, maybe because I'm boring and probably because I seem distant and cold. Which I try hard not to be, but sometimes all I can muster up for a conversation is a quip about the weather. I'm not very liked at this new job, I can tell.

People at work seem to not want to know me. I think it might because I can *seem* stand-offish because I don't always greet everyone with a ""Hi, how are you?"" everytime I pass someone at work. So I've started to notice people turning the other way when they see me coming. I don't blame them, but it certainly doesn't help my self-esteem either. It does hurt, but at the same time I just don't know how to change this part of myself.

Its strange, because I enjoy sites like reddit to learn new things, and discuss things with like-minded. Its a place where I feel there is no pressure to be anything other than my shy introverted nature, whilst discussing things that I like and interest me. I feel no pressure to be a prolific commentor on all things, and only comment when I feel like I have something to say, quite unlike real life conversation (which my psychiatrist believes is unhealthy for my progress. I'm not sure what to believe. I have since stopped seeing this psychiatrist, but still continuing my anti-depressants. I can't afford to pay for a more expensive psychiatrist, which is maybe why he seemed unhelpful in the first place).

I'll leave it there for now, as I'm starting to see this wall of text growing, which leads me to:

**My Question:**

1. Where do I go from here, if traditional help from psychiatrists and counselors haven't made a difference?

2. Should I continue with my medication, even though that doesn't seem to be helping me much either?

3. How do I get my personality back, and stop being such a self-centered, boring, un-fun person to have ever lived?

4. I'm thinking about suicide more and more to end not only my sufferring, but to others around me? My family (parents and sister) don't seem to understand what I'm going through, spouting ""You'll be alright, You'll get though it."" or ""You need a girlfriend"" (which I did by the way, but guess why that fell apart).I'm probably not dangerously close to acting on it, but I am thinking about it more often.

I get really good grades and love what I'm doing (majoring in film). I just moved into my very first apartment and it's going really great. I live with some of my best friends and my boyfriend, whom I love dearly. We've been dating for about 7 months and he changed things for me. We just adopted a 2 month old kitten (her name is Earl Sweatshirt) and she is amazing. I have two minimum wage jobs but it's not too bad, and I'm making enough cash to get by. 

Things are going really good, so why do I feel so sad all the time?

I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember, and of course, didn't realize it until last year, and finally decided to get help. I thought maybe it was seasonal (I really hate Winter) so I was going to one of the counselors my school provides for students for free, and I saw her from October of 2011 to May 2012. Then of course the semester ended and I couldn't see her anymore.

I was doing really good during the school year. Before seeing her, I was on the edge of taking my own life. I just couldn't see what the point was. And she helped me out a lot. And there were certainly times when I felt it creep back in, but for the most part I was okay.

And then summer hit and I was stressed getting used to two jobs, working 60-70 hours a week, but it wasn't bad. It was just a little stress.

And then it hit me. I don't know from where or how, but for the past month I could think of nothing other than killing myself, how disgusting I am, how ugly, worthless, etc. I hate the fact that I feel sad and make others feel sad. I hate that I can't control my emotions around my boyfriend and have dragged him into this (of course he wasn't dragged, and is willing to help, it's just the way I feel). It makes me want to do it even more. That way, the people I love won't have to go through this. I won't put them through it. He can find someone who he can be happy with, and not have to spend every night holding me as I sob.

I started the note to my parents the other night and was so afraid of what I was doing I stopped, then got upset because I couldn't finish it. 

I'm too weak to continue on, but too afraid to end it.

I've tried hurting myself only to make scratches on my arm from the razor because I'm too afraid to push harder.

I can live with punching myself, I guess. 

I haven't done that in a while, but it has happened time and time again and I'm afraid it will just continue to happen. 

And then I get angry at myself for being so stupid. For ever having done it, or thought it, and then telling about it. And it drives me to do more things. It's a cycle of horrible.

I feel so empty sometimes and hate myself for having so much and not appreciating it. 

On top of that, I have horrible self esteem. I struggled with being overweight most of my life and when I got to college lost a lot of weight. People say that I ""look great"" but I still feel fat, ugly. I just cut really short hair and when I look in the mirror I hate myself. I can't go out and see tan skinny girls with long hair and feel good, I just hate myself more. 

I've been struggling with this for a really long time. A loooong time. And he helps, and my friends help, and I do appreciate them, and I hate myself for not just stopping this ridiculousness for their sake.
 
I know I won't take my life. I can't guarantee I won't hurt myself again. I can't afford to go to a shrink or a therapist. So I was hoping maybe you had some answers. I've run out of places to look and my boyfriend suggested here (he's a redditor because I got him into it). I'm so afraid everyone will just tell me to off myself. I hesitated until now because I'm terrified, embarrassed, and afraid that others will get annoyed, or tell me to just do it.

See if your college offers counseling and talk to your parents about what your going through and see if they would be willing to pay for you to see a therapist or psychiatrist. You have to keep going to class, that was my biggest mistake. Don't allow yourself to get behind early in the semester. If it is unbearable and you don't feel you can make it then you should seriously consider withdrawing on a med leave. It will give you time to focus on your mental health and get stable / functional. Otherwise you are wasting your time and money on something you aren't yet ready for. If this is not the case then do everything in your power to stay there. Use tutoring services, go to your professors office hours, dedicate a set amount of time each day to study in the library. Typically for every 1 hour of class you must study for 2 hours on your own time.

I have struggled with depression for most of my adult life (25F).  I've been through a lot... I'll answer if you ask.  

People don't know.  Like my username suggests... I have an ability to nod and smile my way through anything.  I'm not fake, I just am extremely guarded.  I've learned how to be. 

So... 

I just got out of a three year long abusive relationship, and I'm dating. I just, I don't know where to start.  I don't have many friends because my ex wouldn't let me out, and even then I always have had issues opening up to people.  I need to talk. 

Basically... What is bothering me me the most is that I used to be able to cry. I could cry (alone, of course) and move on.  I would feel better after I cried.  I can't now.  I cant.  No matter how hard I try, no matter what I think about... I feel this crushing in my chest, burning in my heart, obsessive thoughts of self hatred and sadness, tingling from my fingers with anxiety...  I want to cry so badly, I just can't.  I haven't cried for over 3 months.  I didn't cry after the break up.  I can't remember the last time I cried, actually.

Now I'm 24 and the money's run out so I'm heading away from a place I love (albeit begrudgingly, it's hard to live up by the Great Lakes without *some* griping about the weather) and back home until I find a new job and have enough to move out somewhere locally.

My parents are pretty supportive (they're both psychiatrists, so they have a pretty good idea of what I'm going through, though I have downplayed the severity of how I'm feeling), but it doesn't make me feel any better. I feel like I've blown six years of my life due to my own incompetence, that if I had just *tried harder*, I could have pushed through the depression and impulsivity and attention issues. If only I had been stronger and more disciplined. As a result, my self-worth is basically near rock-bottom. I am terrified of ending up in a dead-end job for the rest of my life with no degree and no way to ever do what I want in life.

I keep kidding myself that things are getting better. My depression seems to be on a predictable two day cycle. One day I feel great and am able to see the positives in my life – I've recently married my soulmate, and honestly I feel so lucky to have someone so perfect for me and to have such a perfect relationship. I have a good job at an engineering company. I'm close to and on great terms my family, have a small but loyal group of friends, and live a comfortable life. I feel like all the ingredients for happiness are right there

But then the next day, I'm SCREAMING INSIDE. I've had a fucking awful past, bullied and put down by siblings, people from school all through my childhood. I was mental as a child as well, I'd have screaming fits and threaten to kill all my family (I only said it for attention, and because I was angry, I wouldn't really do it). I was hospitalised a few times for trying to kill myself. Nobody liked me, I was a joke. As a teenager I withdrew, spending most of my time inside on my own, doing nothing with my life. I have such an extensive catalog of failures, embarrassments, moments I'm seriously guilty for, and reasons to hate myself.

At around 20 I came out of my shell, moved out of my mom's house into a student flat. My life turned around at that point, and shortly after I met most of my current friends, and my wife. But there was still bad times – drug abuse, I'm talking every day nearly. Before I met my wife, some girl  I barely knew paid me a bit of attention, and I fucked it up, fell in love instantly and became hopelessly attached. When she inevitably rejected me, for being unhinged, I cut myself for the first and last time. Drank two bottles of red wine and considered suicide, then went to her friends' flat, I don't know why, and showed them my cuts. She never spoke to me again. And among my friends, I acted like such a piece of shit so many times, embarrassed myself so many times, I'm surprised they still speak to me.

Why am I going into all this detail I don't know. I have to vent I guess. So now, my problem is I feel like I'm a piece of shit. I say the wrong thing, I come across stupid, I come across shy and nervous, and I'm pretty convinced the majority of people fucking hate me – and it's all because of my fucked up brain. The things I just mentioned, I'm probably wrong – I probably don't come across that way to other people. But my scumbag fucking brain doesn't let me see it that way. I try to seem normal, but I'm not – I'm screaming inside most of the time, trying to put on a brave face.

I go over moments, conversations, mistakes from that day endlessly in my head. First it's the anxiety, then the depression. And the depression seems to show the world in such a negative way, and I feel like I've only being deluding myself when I've felt happy. And the depression becomes so severe that I want to kill myself. I go over all the mistakes I've made in the past, and hate myself for it, and then it gets worse.

At least you got a direct answer - it would be much worse if she didn't have an answer for you or if she was waffling. It's kind of like ripping a bandage off - it stings to do it all at once, but, no matter how much it hurts, at least it's over and you can start to move on.

The first few months hurt so badly there were times I couldn't breathe, times when I cried until I was pretty sure there weren't any tears left in my body.

I still miss him, I still miss the ""what could have been"". But I also know that you can't live for someone else or for what you wanted with them. Live for you - find yourself again, independent of her.

i don't know if this is even the right subreddit, but it seemed the most apropos.  

i am diagnosed with anxiety/depression, currently on lexapro for about a year and a half (as well as ADHD from childhood, currently untreated, previously ritalin).  i'm pretty familiar with my ""states"" and moods and all, and this one is really new to me.

is there something very similar to depression, but replaced with arbitrary anger?  

today has been one of those death-by-a-thousand-papercuts days, and yeah, those'll annoy anyone, of course.  i just have not been able to handle it today.  it started annoying, got obnoxious, and ended irritating, but i couldn't shake it off; it built up.  it **feels** like another low point, where i'm used to everything sliding further into grey territory and can't get myself to even care about anything, but instead replace ""grey"" with ""blood fucking red"".  i have been losing my shit over nothing in particular all day and this is really not normal.  i screamingly called a lady some very unchoice names (through my windshield) as she was pulling out of a parking lot because she ALMOST turned into my lane.  that's not me, really.

my next psych appointment isn't for another few weeks as i was previously (apparently) handling things quite well, but today is just shot.  

is this... like... a thing?  or common?  or common enough to even have a name?  i don't want more of this and i don't even know what to call it to try to fix it.  i'm usually not quick to anger so this is really offputting.

Making friends, getting exercise, gym motivation, most importantly an excuse to leave my bedroom where i live in filth and sleep all day. Those of you that are American may not know that rugby league and rugby union are incredibly different sports with a lot of the same skills. I played league for 8 years and have never played union before this season which i did because a friend talked me into playing for his team (then hurt himself in preseason and has never returned).  For this reason i have basically been treated like i've never played sport in my life all season (union has quite an elitist mentality and most involved see it as a more complex difficult sport). I get 5 minutes on the field at the very end of every game and i quite often have to sit out and watch the starting 15 at training. I've spoken to the coach multiple times and been told again and again that i was training well and would get more and it repeatedly didn't happen. This thing i picked up to feel better about myself has made me feel progressively more worthless all year and as a result i've started doubting myself, actually getting worse, going out with the team less and eventually now i've stopped turning up at all. I get messages from some of the guys in the team asking where i've been and i've lied and said i was sick (by now i'd have to have been sick for a month). My dad asks who i'm playing and says he wants to travel the hour and a half away to see me play and i make up excuses to why he should hold off each week. The finals are very soon and my team will be in them so my mum, stepdad and sisters who think i've been playing all year will want to go. I can't tell them i quit because they were all pissed after i quit league 2 years ago for depression related reasons but i'm running out of excuses. My only options at this point are to go back to football, play 5 minutes a game and hate it for the last month and then have my parents turn up to see me on the sideline looking sad in the finals, keep crying in my room and drinking in the shower refusing to talk to anyone about it or come up with some excuse as to why i have to leave the area for a month and try to seek professional help...

I've tried to heal it myself doing certain things and taking medicine, but it's not getting any better. I guess the human mind is too complex for me to figure out. Should I get professional help?

Regardless of the source of pain, the pain depression causes is real. Don't be ashamed to get help for something that is too complex for most people to understand.

I don't have it in me to act excited about much of anything in my life because of being so severely depressed for so long. 

It is much more painful to be put on the spot with some sort of hopeful expectation of my excitedness by someone else, only to come up blank and empty and awkward. I always and without fail feel like I'm letting the gift giver down by receiving their gift in my flat and numb way. Trying to even just act excited for the sake of the person feels like a lie and makes me feel even worse if I try it. It's not that I don't feel very appreciative, I do, it's that I don't really have the ability to outwardly show it. And because of this essential war going on in my heart and mind in this situation, I dread getting gifts. 

I much prefer opening or discovering gifts alone and being able to thank the person later.  The best scenario is getting something in the mail.

For the longest time I resisted counseling because I arrogantly considered myself too intelligent for it to work but once I went I really did find it helpful. For me, having someone continually nudging me to acknowledge some positive aspects in my life objectively really got me out of one of my major depressive periods. It's really not just laying on a couch and complaining about your parents. I highly advise taking advantage of any psychological counseling available from your school.

And with regards to your loneliness, a relationship can be just as triggering as anything else. In fact I'm more depressed than ever because of a relationship that I was relying on to help me through depression. 

A relationship is usually more trouble than it's worth if your mind's not in a good place.

PM me if you ever need another depressed person's perspective or just someone to talk to. I definitely know how it feels for another person's happiness to make you sad.

I'm assuming the people you would tell are friends or acquaintances. If they would treat you as such, are they truly friends?

I think you may find that they won't stigmatize you. It may be that your fear is a little unfounded and there may be nothing to worry about, let alone hate yourself for it.

Being that you are in college, it is likely that some of them feel or have felt somewhat similar. I'm still an undergrad and while I may be an outlier, most of my friends are struggling with figuring out what they want to do or a lack of passion.

As for your decision, I would say choose a major that has good job opportunities, like engineering or other science majors. I'm not sure exactly which majors have the highest rate of employment or salary, so you may have to do some research. Nothing against liberal arts or social science majors, but as far as I'm aware job opportunities are few and far between. The idea is that you should pick a major that can get you a career that pays well to enable you to get a good job. Then if you should figure out what you actually enjoy, you will have more than enough to pay to go back to school for a new major. Idk if this helps, but good luck.

Also, as others have said, talk with a school counselor/therapist. They can help you with both your issues of depression and not feeling passion. You may also benefit from eating healthier and working out.

&gt;This one, kind of describes what day to day life is like for me, and a lot of other people, too:

“Why? You want to know why?

Step into a tanning booth and fry yourself for two or three days. After your skin bubbles and peels off, roll in coarse salt, then pull on long underwear woven from spun glass and razor wire. Over that goes your regular clothes, as long as they are tight.

Smoke gunpowder and go to school to jump through hoops, sit up and beg, and roll over on command. Listen to the whispers that curl into your head at night, calling you ugly and fat and stupid and bitch and whore and worst of all, ""a disappointment."" Puke and starve and cut and drink because you don't want to feel any of this. Puke and starve and drink and cut because you need the anesthetic and it works. For a while. But then the anesthetic turns into poison and by then it's too late because you are mainlining it now, straight into your soul. It is rotting you and you can't stop.

Look in a mirror and find a ghost. Hear every heartbeat scream that everysinglething is wrong with you.

""Why?"" is the wrong question.

Ask ""Why not?”

It's great, it's fucking awesome to see the world becoming extremelly colorful, socializing with people, not feeling anxiety.

**But.**

It's not fun to have psychosis, to have to double check that the noise or the voice that's calling me is real. 

It's not fun to get angry and ruin friendships forever and it's really degrading not having a solid answer when they ask why I'm behaving like that.

It's not fun to go 2 years on the same bipolar's medication with my mood going up and down and hear that I'm stopping myself from getting healed because it's just depression, just my way of thinking, that I wasn't strong enough to deal with my past and move on.

It's not fun to get partial amnesia and having delusional thoughts, getting paranoid, crashing down to major depression while having flashbacks 24/7.

It's not fun to try your hardest, get a job and then suddenly go nuts.

The doctor's diagnose game:

* Age 8 : Attention seeking. Self-harm to blame the innocent Stepfather.
* Age 9 : Attention seeking. Self-starvation to blame the innocent Stepfather.
* Age 10 : Depression. Taken strapped on top of a car for 15 minutes by Stepfather; proven by witness. Prescribed antidepressant with mood stabilizer for 6 months.

* Age 12 : Depression. Just therapy.
* Age 14: Father died, grief.
* Age 15 : Generalized anxiety disorder. Therapy.
* Age 16 : Not GAD! The doctor was wrong, it was just attention seeking since I don't have anxiety this year and a girlfriend.
* Almost Age 17 : Grief, gave up on seeking medical help.

* Age 23 : Major Depression with Psychosis. ICD-10 F32.3 then later changed to F33.2. Risperidone, Sertraline and Depakote.
* Age 24: ICD-10 F33.3
PDoc: hey, it def. looks like Bipolar , but I'm not going to do that to you, don't worry! Just live your life! Enjoy it while you can! You have finished the treatment.

* Age 26: ICD-10 F99 &amp; F30.0 - Seroquel and Lexapro
* Age 27: Trazodone and Venlafaxine which made my mind explode for 3 weeks and then sink into depression - ICD-10 F33.3 to F33.2 and now F39, It seems like it could be bipolar 2, but let's wait to see how the therapeutic dose of lithium makes you feel. You are still undiagnosed because it's not just depression going on.

58503,,True,browe07,,,,"The world is so complicated that at any moment we are only capable of seeing a small portion of what is there.  The portion that we are most likely to notice comes from experience.  But our experience is also effected by what we are likely to notice.  So the two can combine and create a downward spiral.  First we notice our own inadequacy and through this experience we refine our ability to notice our inadequacy making us much more likely to notice it in the future.  Before long noticing our inadequacy becomes a dominant part of our own particular interpretation of the world.  But its important to remember just how small our interpretation of the world is compared to the whole.  In this way our interpretation of the world isn't so much a reflection of whats real as it is a reflection of what we've gotten good at noticing.

We all have strengths and weaknesses.  Sometimes the world tells us that we need to align our strengths and weaknesses with a particular type in order to be successful.  But I say its more important to know what our strengths and weaknesses are than it is to try to control them.  Instead of forcing success through will, we can place ourselves in roles in society where our paticular skill set is most useful and success comes more naturally.

So let me illuminate your skill set from my limited third person perspective (or at least the small portion which I can extract from your post).  First with the negative, and I'm going to be blunt because I am trying to stay true to your desire for enlightenment not sympathy.  You are really bad at identifying your strengths.  Which is no surprise.  In a typical day how much time do you spend practicing and refining this ability?  And for good reason.  Why would you spend time looking for something you don't expect to find.  And even if you did expect to find it, it would be difficult on account of your lack of practice.  Nothing I say in this post will overturn years of practice in an instant.  I can only give you a starting point.  Faith.  Forget about what seems true.  We've already established how that can become skewed.  Instead, inspite of what you think you know, believe that in your 30 years you can't help but have accumulated something which could be useful to the world.  Which brings me to the strengths.

&gt;I'm not scared of death or pain

Holy shit.  I don't think many people could come close to saying that.  Not sure if you would be inclined, but that seems like a hell of a starting point for a good firefighter.

&gt;I'm so numb

The ability to withstand physical or emotional pain, like any other skill, takes practice but you'd be hard pressed to find many people voluntarily practicing (although believe it or not some people do).  The circumstances of your life have given you practice at this rare skill.  

Those are two examples from your post which maybe you didn't really consider were strengths at all.  Or mayb you have.  And surely there are more but I don't know you beyond this post.  In fact please forgive my ignorance.  Maybe parts like the firefighter bit are off base, but hopefully you can be enlightened by these two main points.

1.  In thirty years you've acquired your own individual set of strengths and weaknesses.  Don't fall for the lie that you've somehow gotten the wrong set.  Instead search for a better understanding of the set you've acquired and the unique place in life where they can be most useful.  Be creative.  Don't let the world tell you what is and isn't useful.  Its a complex world and your skills are bound to be needed somewhere.  As you begin to understand what that somewhere might be then success will follow naturally.

2.  Part of this search will require refining your ability to identify your own strengths.  But without having much practice you'll have to believe they are there in order to have a reason to continue looking.  But this belief will eventually begin to prove itself.  As your skill increases you will even reexamine your past understanding and replace it with a more beautiful and full understanding of the world.  The ""correctness"" of what you are seeing now is an illusion.  There is so much more to the world than the portion that we notice.",,0.0,,2013-08-21 03:18:11,,,0,1377052093,,,,0,,cbs0clx,,,,,t3_1kq9jc,,,t1_cbs0clx,,,,t3_1kq9jc,,,,,,,,1429756862.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

To start this off, I'm fifteen, and have made quite a few mistakes in my life, most of which occurring after my grandmother died. She and I were very close. She was my go-to person. 
I dated an incredibly manipulative girl for more than a year, and her attention grabbing antics fucked me up pretty bad. She pretended she was raped, at one point. 
Yeah. 
I was pretty addicted to cigarettes from 11-12, but quit when I coughed up blood one morning. I've recently been getting back into them. 
I've suppressed most of my major emotions for a few years now. The emotions that I allow myself to emit are more often than not a façade. 
I have few joys in my life. Gaming, being stoned, animals, and most prominently, talking to my dream girl, who I know I will never be with. 
I've been cutting my self (very small cuts, mind you) over the course of about half a year. 
I failed three of my classes because I wasn't feeling motivated. 

But my life hasn't been bad. I have loving parents who accept me for my mistakes (they don't know about half of them), and constantly provide needed love and support, trying to provide me with much needed happiness, poor as we are. I love them. My family, and thinking about how much shit it would put them through, is the only reason I haven't killed myself yet. The only time I actually came close, I thought about them, and went to make myself vomit up the pills I took. 

Im sorry for having said all this. It actually feels kind of nice to get it all out in the open.

214327,,True,geocentrist,,,,"&gt;Relationships are dangling by a thin string no matter how strong you think it is.

Yes that is true.  But most people have enough difficulty in their lives than to deal with depressed people I think.  They want people that are going to make them happy and continually being there for someone who is depressed is difficult.

&gt;But my most feared thought is that Allah Hates me. I am terrified that because of my sins Allah will not Accept me and He will Send me to Hell and I'll never see my family again. I'm afraid that He's Lifted His Guidance, Blessings, and Love from me and that I'm all alone with no one to love me.

I don't know much about this because I am not religious.  But it really sounds more like an expression of anxiety than anything else.  I suggest you speak to a doctor and talk about whether some meds might be right for you.  Also you can talk to a therapist as well.  Perhaps there are environmental factors causing this anxiety.

97092,,True,Peraou,,,,"Well i suppose I'm not the best person to comment on this, because my parents only found out when my best friend called them after I was in the hospital for a couple of days.  But I have a similar relationship with them that you do.  Here's the thing, when you are having a hard time with your parents, it's best not to tell them at first.  The very first thing you should do is go see a doctor, there are many many places where you can go for free to like a walk-in-clinic or something.  

Tell them you think you have depression, and they can diagnose it for you.  I felt exactly, exactly the way you do right now at the beginning of this year.  I mean I'm 19 but I still had trouble talking to my parents about it because we really don't get along.  Don't worry about any of that future stuff because all of that worry isn't your fault, it's just a biological failure in the brain - and thats the same thing with feeling worthless.  You're going to have to go on some pills to fix that, so once you've seen that doctor first on your own, you can go to your parents with proof that you're, well, sick and need help.  

It's just like getting cancer or something - it's an actual biological problem that needs help, and isn't your fault at all.  But before you talk to your parents, you should really try and talk to a friend who you're close with because when you don't get along with your parents your friends are all you have.  (at least for me because I don't have any siblings) but if you do have a brother or sister, maybe you could talk to them too.  

But you also need to know that every single thing that's happening to you are the regular symptoms of depression - every single bad thing that you listed.  It takes away your energy, makes you really mad sometimes for no reason, makes it really hard to be social, and if you have anxiety you worry like a maniac about all sorts of school stuff.  And when you're depressed you can't function properly enough to do basic stuff, let alone get good grades.  

Trust me I'm the exact same.  I left high school with a 94 average, but when my depression got worse (especially in university) i could barely go to class.  Maybe you could use a bit of time off?

Anyway, all of this is treatable and can be fixed.  No matter how trapped and scared you feel, make sure to remember that it's all in your head.  I know that doesn't make it feel any better, but do your best to let go and not care about anything at all.  That way you can help calm yourself down.  

if you need any more help or advice at all, just comment back and I'll be happy to help for as long as you need it.  I had my friends to help me, and without them I don't know what I would have done, and you deserve the same.

98872,,True,Golden_orb,,,,"Your advice has an undertone of men should feel bad for sexualizing women. I can not get behind this. One of the healthiest attitudes towards sex if being upfront about your intentions and not having to figure out how to do the right thing. Although you are not advising men to tiptoe around women per say, following your guidance will probably have that effect. When men express attraction it can be interpreted as creepy but in my experience it is only so by the degree of pushiness of manipulativeness. Women don't really have a problem with coming off as creeps because even if a guy is not interested he will still be flattered. This is precisely as you say because sexual attention from men is a lot more aggressive but I would also like to add that there might also be a biological bias women have inbuilt as getting knocked up by a rapist has hugely life altering consequences. But to get back to my point, the answer to stop being a creeper is not to start building up any shame about sexual desires or pussyfooting around women, it is to be open and unapologetic about your intentions and when facing rejection taking it in stride. I would also like to add that women sexualize men just as much as men do women. The just do it slightly differently. Their judgments are not near as superficial as mens but if you look at what biologically makes sense in a mate in a historical context it adds up. Men go for fertility women go for a multitude of psychological factors and social/economical status. Of course women also enjoy a great physique just as men will enjoy a great personality but the averages are skewed. My advice to OP is better yourself and once you feel good about yourself it will attract others. ~~Also don't take dating advice from bitter women.~~ *Uncalled-for.*",,0.0,,2012-11-06 16:42:31,,,0,1352233433,,,,0,,c6xajbt,,,,,t3_12okan,,,t1_c6xajbt,,,,t1_c6wxnjj,,,,,,,,1430335360.0,,-5,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,-5,,

I've been depressed for who knows how long, but a month ago I finally sought treatment. I've been prescribed a small dosage of Zoloft, but am not really feeling it. Been kind of suicidal and have been self harming as of late, which was a concern. Talked to the doctor and he said he'd up my dosage if I meet with him.

The reason I'm posting here today is because I want to proactively help myself feel better. My plan is pretty simple, and probably sounds pretty dumb, but I want to make a video for myself, where I respond to questions regarding my depression (causes, extent of depression, etc). I hate to ask much of you, but if you could please supply some questions, I feel it'd be more effective.

To help out, I'll provide a brief summary of my depressed life.

My depression started about 5 years ago (estimate). Since then it has affected my grades and social life. (used to be A student, now barely achieving 3.0, hardly any friends) I moved to a new state, saw it as a new start. Depression worsened, grades stayed the same, things got dark. Then about a year ago, I met an amazing girl who asked me out, but she has her own set of problems. Her parents are awful people and she was a victim of rape (while we were dating). She came very close to suicide (talked to her at 4am, had to call the house). She also struggles with depression. She can be stressful at times but I love her more than anything else. As for my relationship with my parents, it's pretty rocky. My mom and I argue a lot, and my dad is out working in a different state. (family is moving to that state, I'm questioning whether or not to join them)

*Just typing this made me realize that my life is a mess right now. I totally understand if a lot of you aren't willing/able to help, but obviously if you do I'd greatly appreciate it.

Don't know where you live but that wage demand usually requires a developed skill.

Not all [http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/LHCA.asp] (lighthouses) are automated and those that are probably require some form of upkeep. 

Have you explored trades like machinist, electrician, welder, pipe-fitter, line technician (bring it up because you said you like routine and manual)? They might be too detail-oriented for you, but there's few jobs where you can blow off details.

You could go into security now while you figure it out, and continue to develop your portfolio. Motion graphics (post-production stuff, like for a VFX house) pays well if you develop a portfolio for it. If you really hate people and are talented with any sort of design, you could reach a point where freelancing becomes your own business. That sort of thing takes years to build up unless you have a super specific skill or piece of equipment no one else has, but can be done.

While it's probably not an industry doing too well depending on the market, hotels offer a surprising amount of solitary work. Night auditing is detail intensive but may help you access other positions in a corporate structure that otherwise demand hotel management degrees, such as head of security, marketing and advertising jobs (or just start at the bottom in one of those if you can).

Book depositories and private archives are great for the sort of personality you describe. If the library is affiliated with a university or public, they will seek candidates from within the university or with a masters in library science (my experience). 

Clerk work can be quiet and uninvolved, qualifications depend on the hiring organization. Clerking for a city usually requires you pass an exam and have a bachelor's. City and state jobs can open a world of benefits. Look at the hiring sites of nearby cities for ideas. They need city planners, surveyors, landscapers, bus drivers, all kinds of stuff.

If you haven't yet, submit your work to every PR firm and ad agency you could possibly relocate to work for, even those not advertising open positions (you should have an unbiased working professional look at your portfolio first to confirm this is a good idea). Many companies have in-house PR and design departments, so just look into who you want to work for and keep at it.

Finally, my friend worked in a sex shop (toys, videos, booths) and he liked it. He's weird though. That definitely falls in the retail income category and was fairly social.",,0.0,,2014-01-22 16:59:18,,,0,1390410198,,,,0,,cew18cm,,,,,t3_1vuu88,,,t1_cew18cm,,,,t3_1vuu88,,,,,,,,1432055746.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

However, I'm almost 20, I'm a sophomore in college, and I feel that I care about other people's perception of me much more than I used to... And to an extremely unhealthy extent. 

The more ridiculous part is, I am always focused on people who I don't even associate with rather than the people that I'm in contact with!

Basically, during my freshman year of college, I was in a bad place and I did many things I'm not proud of. And also got involved in situations that I don't even know how the f*ck I got myself into. Needless to say, many people got a bad impression of me, and even 'friends' looked down on me. 

However, as a sophomore, I matured a lot. Although I was still depressed ((I've had depression for 6+ years)), I refrained from making stupid choices. I chose to stay low key and I basically lost contact with everyone from freshman year. I made a couple of great friends at my college and they bettered me. My plan was to focus on academics. And I did so much better than freshman year, but there were times when I got so depressed an/or angry over thinking about people from the past's perception of me that I would neglect studying/classes for weeks at a time or sleep all day for several days. When I did force myself to study, most of the time I would not be able to concentrate 100% because I was thinking about this and other stuff from the past that angered me. I couldn't even completely focus during exams!

All I want is to go back in time and change myself, OR show them that I'm not that person anymore. 

I know it doesn't matter.. They don't even think about me nor do they care. Yet I can't stop myself from feeling this way! I've finished up my sophomore year now and I'm still feeling this way.

Im a 27/m who throughout life struggled with depression.  I have worked with various therapists, taken various medications, and generally feel that my experience with therapists was hampered by lack of trust and insecurity of my thoughts.  I have self-injured, unsuccessfully achieved mediocre fails in suicide attempts, abused alcohol and pot, but felt like this was all passing by.

I remember a marked 'interest' in the past of suicidal thoughts involving vehicles.  Arguably, more than thoughts (two of my suicide 'attempts' involved totaling low end American vehicles).  It scared the shit out of me.  The thoughts.  The actual actions (that I almost felt like weren't my actions to own).

Regardless--

I've felt clean of these thoughts for a year +/-.  I thought all was behind me, and I just needed to keep a positive attitude and a chin up to life.

Recently I have found these thoughts (not while driving yet) returning.     It honestly scares me.  I felt like this was a period that I finally overcame... I am (by most metrics) successful, make good money, have a supportive S.O., but -- alas -- I find these visualizations of vehicular suicide returning.

So far they have mostly been after social drinking, or (not drinking) a night while trying to sleep.  I feel like i've 'been here' before, and this slowly progresses to a place where they occur while ACTUALLY driving.

So; my reddit r/depression/ friends.

I can't imagine where I'd be if I didn't have the support system I do. I'm still pretty messed up as is.

This post really resonated with me and while my ability to write coherently fades in the middle of the night, I just really wanted to share a little bit about myself. It's scary how easy it is to be alone these days. Feel free to send me a pm if you ever need an open ear (or eye?)

Some times I've regretted coming off it, and I (strangely) think of it fondly. Anyway, I started mirtazapine about 4/5 weeks ago (I swapped over from venlafaxine) and am up to 45mg a night. There's a few things I've noticed so far:

* the lower dose made me really sleepy within a few hours of taking it, and pretty much ended my insomnia. Mirtazapine is a pretty potent antihistamine, which is why you'll feel really sleepy. Towards the higher doses (either 30mg or 45mg) the sleepiness should wear off a little as the norepinephrine kicks in.

* I crave food pretty much all the time, especially of an evening. It tends to be sweet, carby things too, like doughnuts. Infact just thinking about it is making me hungry :D I don't think I'm alone either, mirtazapine is pretty heavily linked to an increase of appitite.

* I don't have any sexual side effects, whereas I did on SSRI/SNRI's.

* the brain fog has gone, and I feel much more mentally sharp than on any other antidepressant. My moods have also improved a bit, though not massively.

Generally, mirtazapine has solved half my problems so I do feel a lot better on it. I hope it works for you too :) I think this is the first antidepressant I've wanted to keep taking, and I told my doc as much. I'm adding burpropion in the mornings (I take mirtazapine at night cos of the drowsiness) as a stimulant and to lift my moods some more, and to give me some motivation..

You're not an asshole. When it comes to therapy and things to help you, you NEED to be selfish. If you're not, you'll be like me and not tell your therapist everything that's really bothering you, you'll not go as much as you really think you should, you'll hurt yourself more. In part, by not giving you the help you needed when you asked for it, he DID bring it on himself.

""Adulthood"" isn't a rigid thing. If you think about it, what would the world really be like if all adults 'grew up' and acted 'mature'? We wouldn't have had any cartoons or entertainment as kids, we would've been very bored. Immaturity in adults can be a good thing! :) It helps you connect more easily to a younger audience.

Prayer might help you, if only just to get everything out and put the pressure onto the shoulders of another being that may or may not really exist.

I think an important part of a person's recovery is letting go of those who don't understand what you are going through, and this might be people who are close to you, like family and friends. But to recover you don't need everyone to understand you, only a few, like a therapist, or a close friend. I hope that helps you get rid of some of that frustration.


I've felt so many things I don't want to feel but that I can't avoid. Its weird though, sometimes I WANT to be sad and depressed, ive never heard of anyone saying that and i think even my therapist didnt know what to say.   Frustration, hopelessness, despair, loneliness, like I can't talk to any real person about it, suicide, how I want to do it but i cant, how when i do it ill be sure theres no chance of surviving, where to do it. Why I try so hard to please any girl but ive never had any real relationship, how i got hurt too bad to want anything sexual again but at the same time dont want to trust anyone new. I need emotional connection and validation but i cant do anything about it.

Today is a bad day. I wouldnt care if i wasnt sitting on the edge of my seat for the response of a girl i got flowers for. But most likely the ""oh valentine.."" text is all ill get no matter how much I want it. I wish I knew how much she had invested in me but i know it isnt as much as i have in her.

I've been on anti-depressants since last spring and seen a huge improvement, but have still had persistent issues that never seemed to resolve. Feeling foggy all the time, never feeling interested in anything, and feeling like I'm on auto-pilot all the time. Well, I had a somewhat, ahem... interesting? epiphany a couple of days ago that have lead to an immediate improvement now that I have a specific feeling to watch out for. 

It started with porn. Or rather, sorry, it started with me listening to [Marconi Union – Weightless](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMmMNyTwePY), which is supposed to be one of the most relaxing songs ever written, on repeat for about a half hour and attempting to relax during the first downtime that I had experienced in near recent memory. I finally got to the point where I wasn't vibrating through the walls stressed and decided to surf around on some adult websites for a bit. Details aside, it was an entirely different experience than what I'm used to. 

This is going to be really hard to explain. Typically I have a huge problem connecting a picture of someone to a real person. It takes time and effort to think of a flat, two dimensional image as being a person with their own emotions at the time that it was taken. Not just with people either. When I look at scenery, even if it's beautiful, I won't feel anything. Music is even difficult to enjoy. This has been normal for me for as long as I can remember. 

Anyway, I was surfing and imagine my surprise when these pictures weren't suddenly just pleasing shapes, they were *people*, and hot damn did it make a difference. The whole experience lead to me questioning what my baseline day to day experience is even supposed to be like, something that I hadn't really bothered doing because it felt normal to me. I realized that it wasn't just two dimensional images that my brain was doing this to. I was going on auto-pilot and not becoming invested in my surroundings pretty much consistently throughout my day. I talked to my doctor about it and was just shocked to find out that it's a real thing that can sometimes accompany anxiety and depression, and that it was something temporary that could be worked through. I ended up being diagnosed with Depersonalization and Derealization and we went over techniques to combat them.

I talked with them about it for a long time and, embarrassing moments aside, really feel like it was huge progress. I've mostly tamed my crippling depression down to the point that it's something that I can work with on a day to day basis, but was wondering why I wasn't feeling better about life. This is like discovering that there's a third dimension you never knew existed. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just had to get that off my chest. As weird as it has been, it has also been an amazing and almost instant improvement to my quality of life, just knowing that it's real and something that can be combated.

110796,,True,[deleted],,,,"&gt;I think it's all made up. I don't really feel like that. I shouldn't ask for help. Anyways, I have my ups and downs. Probably I'll feel better tomorrow.

I felt that for the longest time too. After I actually asked for help, I got more used to the idea of accepting my problems and knowing that I couldn't deal with them on my own. I go through ups and downs too, and during the ups, I would often feel as if the downs would never come again. Since depression/mental problems are somewhat stigmatized by our society, it was easy for me to be deluded by this. Therapy helped, a lot. If anything, I gained a more realistic outlook and accepted the fact that sometimes I'd feel great, like the king of the world, even if the day before I felt like I wanted to die. I also feel like I have better control now. It's all part of the process. Please don't fool yourself into thinking you're okay if you're not. Go get help.

&gt;I'm afraid that I'll fail...even though I went through college with a 4.0 GPA.

Don't even get me started. I tortured myself over grades for the past few years because it was the only thing that made me feel good about myself. I aced organic chemistry, linear algebra, differential equations, quantum physics, statistics, etc. and totally burned myself out doing it. However, ever since starting therapy, the pervasive sense of inferiority that nearly drove me off the edge has subsided. This is the first time in my life that I feel like I can be rational and reasonable about school. 

&gt;I feel this need to cry. This empty space in my chest. I can't see myself as a valuable person. I don't want relationships right now. I'm still thinking about him. I haven't met anyone who I would be interested in. I don't know how to kiss or have sex. I don't drink. i don't like flirting. I can't live feeling like this now, and then feeling much better the other.

I'm totally in your boat. I repressed the fuck out of all feeling toward women for the longest time and always made myself act aloof and uninterested. I'm not bad at making friends, talking to girls, and I don't think I'm downright ugly (maybe not an ass-magnet, but not hideous either). For me, the problem is that my ""default"" is concealing and repressing feelings that make me uncomfortable. This has thus far left me with no real relationships or sexual experiences. Yeah, it hurts, but I think I'm finally getting over it. Ddrinking a bit helps. You don't have to go crazy, just have a few beers. You'd be surprised how much it can help you get over the ""hump"" of your inhibitions. I certainly was. Also, I'd advise you to talk to more guys (and people in general) and not get too obsessed over one in particular. I did that once (with a girl, mind you!). It didn't end well and seriously fucked with my head. It was my brain going crazy from years of having no emotional connections to anybody; it lashed out and grabbed on tight to the first one it found, and then it didn't let go. Needless to say, that was not a good idea (though it was a good learning experience). 

&gt;But then, if you ask me tomorrow, at work. I'll say I'm fine. I have dreams, I am cute, I have a nice smile and I'm the best at what I do.

This isn't always such a bad thing. I *know* it's annoying and I *know* it feels really fake, but bringing up your real feelings all the time just makes you (well, for me) gloomier. Go through the motions during the day, and find someone you can talk to privately. 

Also, feel free to PM me if you wanna chat. I'm all ears and am desperately trying to avoid doing my homework assignments due tomorrow... :-D",,0.0,,2012-05-29 15:56:29,,,0,False,,,,0,,c4tnr2n,,,,,t3_u9np6,,,t1_c4tnr2n,,,,t3_u9np6,,,,,,,,1429022791.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

But I'm so lost in all my ""troubles"" that I can't even decide how to feel. I'm a freshman in college and have absolutely zero academic confidence. I fail everything except history and some writing. 
School has torn at my soul since childhood. Sure it started like everyone who said they hate school because it's boring. But as time went I realized how much I have a negative disposition towards all teachers which I know is complete self sabotage for learning. I cry Monday mornings because it means I'm going to be absolutely miserable for the next 5 days. I know I need to suck it up though. I recognize the indisputable necessity for education in today's society. But I just can't do it. And I feel like since I'm incapable of doing well in school. I will be incapable of doing well in society. 
I have been given so many advantages that are squandered. My private university education is being paid for by a family friend with strings attached that are hanging me. I have to do very well and then graduate school and then a successful fulfilling profession because it's what THEY want. (I can't afford school otherwise)  I couldn't care less. Which is why I sleep through classes and don't study. Because what's the point if I'm going to fail and disappoint everyone anyway.
I know that when my grades come in I will surely cause the most disappointment my parents and family have ever felt. Because their son is a loser who will probably fail out of college. 

I've slowly lost almost all of my friends. I cannot maintain healthy relationships or they move away. I have a long term girlfriend who I'm with because she needs me and would die if I left.

My depression stems way back to when I was a kid. My family moved from a country town to the city when I was 9 and I moved between 5 schools, never learning how to make friends let alone keep them. Then came high school where I was mercilessly bullied, it was usually racial taunts (I'm Aboriginal Australian) but it did reach physical pushing. My self esteem was in tatters but I made it out alive. I did start feeling better as I entered the adult world and started studying social work at university but that fell apart when my younger sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. We struggled financially, I quit study and got a job to help pay the bills and played mum for my other sister. Thankfully she's in remission now but at the time there were a lot of fights and sad feelings. Things were never the same afterwards but they started getting better, I got a different job, one where I met my current boyfriend at (he's literally the only thing keeping me sane right now, I wouldn't be here if not for him) and importantly I started treatment for my depression. I'm on antidepressants and cognitive behavioural therapy. It's kind of working but I relapsed into a dark and terrible place when my Dad was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma early this year and it's terminal. It's not fair, I'm so scared and angry at the world. My boyfriend is scared that I might take my life if cancer claims my Dad and honestly he's right. I have aggressive 'bad weeks' where I skip work, don't eat and lay in bed crying or sleeping but I'm still here trying my hardest to get through this. 

Sorry for the wall of text, it is nice to finally get everything down though, it's not everything but I'm sure everyone here knows the feelings you go through when life constantly deals you crap cards and kicks you while you're down.
In short my depression feeds off my low self-esteem and social anxiety. I can't imagine not being sad all the time, everyone tells me that I have good reason to be but I don't want pity parties, I want friends that honestly care and want to help me out if this pit I'm in.

105840,,True,[deleted],,,,"If you're in school, it might be best to go to a counselor or teacher with whom you're comfortable. Teachers (at least in my state) are legally required to inform your parents or guardians (or law enforcement, or whatever other appropriate organization) about the possibility of you harming yourself or another. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, then I would recommend trying the hospital. However, it's possible that you don't need institutionalization at all. I suffered pretty severe depression and anxiety issues, and after several years of therapy and antidepressants, I was fine without being in a hospital at all.

Hope this helps. 

EDIT: Actually, I left something out. I was in a psych ward for a short time, although if I remember correctly, hospitals will only keep you if you're considered a threat to yourself. Depression without the intent to harm yourself is likely not a matter for a hospital.

I then slammed my door and burst into tears. It seems I'm emotional this morning.      

I don't know how to feel or what to think. I feel horrible for saying that, but is it because I don't mean it or because I broke a promise to myself? Should I not care and move on?  Pull out my apathetic mask?

I really need to make an appointment with a counselor, but I keep pushing it off because I don't know what to say on the phone.

Depression is something hard to talk about. We all are afraid of sharing our weakness with a stigmatizing society  that generally wouldn't understand.  So we tell ourselves the good old ""if you fake it you make it"" motto, even though we know well that it's not gonna work. In the end we just become used to it, and used to hide it, entering an acceptance phase that might relieve the pain... until something happens that reminds us of how stupid and useless we feel. I don't know the solution, but hiding and avoiding everything is not gonna help solving it. Sharing is the hard route, facing your own fears requires courage, but nobody said it's gonna be easy.

However, we don't really know your situation and I don't think anyone here can give you much advice, other than trying to open your eyes to other possible points of view. Your boyfriend might have been a fucktard and act without thinking or he might have been extremely scared, under a situation that not many people would know how to react. If it got to the point that you got hospitalized, even if it was unwillingly and you think it wasn't real, it might have been scary enough for the doctor to send you there. 

It's not about how mild the drug was. Over 99% of the first attempts of suicide are failures. The thing is that without help it might get worse.

Before I begin, let me state that I've been homeschooled for years, and I lost all my friends when I got pulled out of the school system.

So, a few years ago, there was this beautiful game called Faunasphere run by Big Fish Games. It was my favourite game so it's ending (sorry, ""phasing out"") alone was sad, but at least I made plenty of good friends on there. Unfortunately, I lost most of them because I never got the chance to exchange info with them. I did keep a few though (their names might come up, so: doglove123, jadesen, careegirl, blubair, and ZGirl22, the reasoning for this post. Using screen names for privacy issues). Kept in touch with most of them for at least a year, until my assholery started driving them away (tbh, I don't know why they stayed as long as they did. I'm not funny, or smart, of clever, or good looking, or talented); first blu, when I stopped using facebook (the only way I had contact with her). Also me and her friend getting into a fight (well, I say ""fight"", it was more her calling me names and me trying desperately to defend  myself) probably didn't help; then doglove, when I couldn't reciprocate her crush on me (no idea why she had a crush in the first place; read above); then caree, because she was busy with school; jade, when... you know I don't really know we just fell out of contact; but Z... there's a lot of story with Z.

I met her at a mutual friend's party in FS (funny thing is, I don't even remember who's party it was). I was an awkward little shit, and I guess she took pity on me or something, and took me under her wing. We would go over to her house (""spheres"", they were called) and play truth or dare and do ""karaoke"" (which involved us typing words into the little chat boxes and hitting enter. No actual singing, my kind of singing). One time I remember us even going out into one of the worlds and making blu tell us a story about her hairy uncle named Joe (I have no idea). Thinking back on it now, it was probably more puppy love, but I developed a crush on Z. Not really knowing how to tell her (and having never been able to tell my only other crush because I was so awkward), I kept it to myself for a while. Eventually though, and with awkward things being said more precisely through writing, I told her. Pretty quickly after that, she jumped ship, saying ""I have to go"" and rushing offline before I could say anything (can't say I blame her). Didn't see her again for about 6 months, until she came back on. She acted like nothing had happened, though (again, can't say I blame her). Nothing (memorable) happened for a while, until the end. March 14, the night before the end of faunasphere. She couldn't get on the game again the next day, so she was saying goodbye to everyone that night. She said some slightly generic goodbyes to everyone (including me) before asking me to go someplace private. ~~Our characters did it~~ (Ignore that, I'm actually 5). She told me she loved me too.

Me being the confused, awkward, lovesick little fuck I was, I logged off and went outside (in the rain), ~~and pondered life for a bit~~ and thought. My highly logical lovesick brain decided that this must me some clever ruse (cool story bro), and that she was lying to me. Why you ask? What sort of gain would she get from it? How would this benefit her life? I have no idea, but that didn't matter to old me. I created the persona Ghost (grey sweatshirt, glowing blue eyes with lightning streaking through them, black hair. Yeah, I never really wasn't 5).

A while ago, I'd created a website for a ~~really shitty~~ totally amazing youtube channel I was doing. It had a live chat thing (via chatroll). Why? No idea. It sounded cool. This is what I'd been using to communicate with most people (except Blu and usually caree). That's what we kept using up until everyone left. Speaking of which, we're finally getting there!

Stayed in character as Ghost for a while, until I realized I'd gotten over it. Still being 5, I created a new persona that was an angel, with white hair, ever-changing eye colour, and wings (fuck yeah). Because thankfully all my friends were 5, too, we had ~~an~~ ~~a few~~ ~~a couple~~ ~~several~~ a shitload of RPs (role plays, for those older than 5. What's wrong with you?!). Don't know where I'm going with this rp thing.

Anti-climactic ending time! Woo: Z was never really open with information. Even when I asked, she would never really tell me anything. Still don't know her name, even. I promised myself I would never really pry, because I figured she would take it as some lack of trust or something. One day, though, about ~6 months ago, after much pressuring from my cousin (though it's not her fault; I never had to go through with it) I did pry. Not just that, but I was a dick about it. I'd been a dick all throughout our friendship. And one day, I want to say some time around the 12th of August, she left. Without a word, she just left, and deleted all of her accounts and every way I had to contact her and now I'll never see her again and it's all my fault and I feel like the lowest form of life and I deserve to have never existed.

tl;dr: I dun fucked up.

(I'll get around to editing this for better readability later, right now I just wanted to get this off my chest. Breath it in. Don't, it's probably carcinogenic.)

**Edit1:** Okay so I just posted this and holy shit it's a wall of text and I'm already sorry to anyone who tries to read all of that.

**Edit2:** Oh yeah, and to add a bit more to it, the only person that knows is my cousin. I don't want to tell my parents/anyone else (wait, who else would I tell, I litterally have no friends) because I don't want to make them feel worse/worry about me/be disappointed/etc.

**Edit3:** So, adding a bit more to the post-confession, pre-angel phase: was a bit depressed then, too. Again, never told anyone (besides a few of my friends and maybe my cousin) about my feelings for Z. My depression then was nothing compared to now, though. I was semi-suicidal then (luckily only thoughts, never followed through, that shit could kill me); now I just don't care enough to kill myself, or even think about it. Also, when I was in my suicidal phase, I told one or two of my friends (I think it was dhbristol); my parents were away and I was thinking about the knives in the kitchen and she just replied with something along the lines of ""nah, the stuff under the sink is much more deadly."" Made me laugh, but it was also serious enough (like, ""holy shit all it would take is me drinking some bleach and I cease to exist"") that I stopped, at least temporarily.

**Edit4:** Changed a few minor things for better readability. Also, while I'm here, in case you hadn't guessed, I'm an only child. Only person that comes close to being a sibling is my cousin, who I mentioned a few times.

**Edit5:** So guess what just came up in conversations? I was being lectured for the umpteenth time, and was told that ""I'm going to lose friends"" and I replied with having already lost them all. And it was just what I expected. The fake sympathy, the pity, the talking-behind-my-back. I don't even care. I'm a superhero. Nothing can touch me.

I am a guy in high school. Im considered nice and caring by many of those around me.Anyways, my situation:
Ive known this girl who has gone through a lot. She's been depressed before i knew her, she tells me a lot of reasons why (mostly how a guy mistreated her sexually in 6th grade, but the list goes on). Shes cut herself and done things she isnt proud of and has told me she wants to stop. she is pretty open about these things with me  More info info: shes a talented singer and guitar player, really smart, she wants to be a missionary when she gets older, also, she has a therapist.
Ive been helping her endure alot of these things for about 4 years now. this time around, she had a girlfriend, they broke up, she got so depressed that she smoked some pot after work and then drank something and drove, got pulled over, and her mom had to get her. She was then punished ( chores) but got mad so her parents kicked her out for the day, where i would get her to keep me up to date on what shes doing so she can be safe, and she stays at a friend from her churches house. Apparently im the only one who knows this except family and 2 other friends.  

So a few days later i invite her to the beach. she drives there and i meet her there. we are at a campsite (on the beach) and the rangers tell us to move the car out of the lane. I offer to go with her to drop the car off and walk back, however she says no, pulls me to the side, and tells me that she has smoked since she was 16 (18 now) and didnt want me to know but told me anyways (she really trusts me). later we sat on the beach and just talked about school, general subjects, and had a great time. I care about her very much. I've lost sleep and I've been stressing out a lot. 

Apparently im the only one who cares about her as much as I do.

Fast forward to a two days ago, she is thinking about things and getting worse, she sits at McDonald's parking lot at 3 am and I text her and she says that she is going to Walmart to sleep there. I talk her into going home. Well yesterday, she hangs out with a friend and has not answered her texts-and I freak out knowing how she is. Today I learned she's getting worse and at the mental hospital (her therapist heard her say something).im less stressed now that she is in good hands but I'm not the one struggling here. 

Here are some notable things you should know:
Her being bi causes no issues with her (her church supports it too as does family)

She says I and one other person know the most about her. In terms of ""how well you know a person"" well I'm up there. 

**I want some help on how to help her when she gets out of the hospital, and to be the best most supporting friend I can be**. I love her so much (as a friend, we discussed dating but I realized it wouldn't help whatsoever) 

I'm also trying to edge her out of smoking.

I've always been terrified of failure, or what I perceive as failure. For example, way back in elementary school, not doing your homework would mean you would have to stay indoors for your recess. This would always leave me in tears, and looking back I'm not sure why. I rarely missed homework assignments until 7th grade.

In 7th grade, my grades dropped. I had, up until that point, been a straight-A student who always did his homework, etc. I'm not sure what caused it exactly, but my homeroom teacher (our school had language arts and writing and social studies taught in our homeroom by said teacher) was a ""tough"" grader. I mean, he didn't really grade unfairly or anything, but I guess he treated me as more mature than I was and didn't hand-hold me. At any rate, I started getting Bs, Cs, and even Ds and it felt pretty bad. Missing recess didn't bother me as much as it did even a year earlier, but I still felt ashamed whenever I missed homework assignments (which started happening often). Sometimes, I would outright refuse to go to school or go late because I hadn't finished something. 

At some point in the year, I got some food poisoning and was sent home. Food poisoning doesn't last that long and I left on a Friday, but I continued staying at home for about a week at least. My parents didn't really push me because they thought I was sicker than I was. After that, things continued as they were before. However, I got a similar case of food poisoning later in the year, and I did the same thing. I stayed at home longer than I should've because I really hated going to school. (This is going to appear random and poorly formatted, but I just remembered that my parents and I were blaming the school for being boring and unchallenging academically, etc. The school was mediocre when it came to anything besides liberal arts.) I finished 7th grade with something like 25 absent days and a similar number of late days.

Once 8th grade began, the same things continued. My ability to do homework seemed to have vanished entirely, so I was up in the early hours of the morning procrastinating relatively straightforward assignments. Whenever I gave up on working in the night, I would try to wake up early and finish homework before I had to leave for school. This undoubtedly made me late tons of times and often I would procrastinate projects for so long I would have hours of work to do before school began. Naturally, this made me late many times and the lack of sleep was making me late on days when I actually managed to finish my work. I would also miss school *much* more frequently (i.e. once a week) and it was harder and harder to show up after I missed a school day because of how ashamed I felt. My parents would punish me every time I refused to go to school (i.e. no television / internet / whatever. I would essentially just read books and sleep). My grades went up in liberal arts but decreased greatly in every other subject. In math and science my grades dropped to Bs because I missed tons of work. I didn't even get a grade for French because I didn't do enough (apparently it was a first) but the school didn't give me too much shit for it. (Also, I was meeting with the principal and other school faculty because obviously they were trying to do something about me missing so much school). 

Between 7th and 8th grades, I was preparing to take the SHSAT to get into [Stuyvesant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School). I took the test at the beginning of 8th grade, and got my results in the spring. After that, I felt like less of a failure because I got into a difficult school, but I was still rejected from other high schools where you have to apply with a portfolio and grades instead of just a test score, which felt pretty bad. 

9th grade was supposed to be the beginning of change. All of the problems we blamed on my old school were no longer present. However, after a couple of weeks, it was clear that it wasn't the school that caused my problems; it was me. The same habits continued, and worsened. My grades took a nosedive I had never seen before and I failed my first math test ever. I had much more work to do and I had to study for tests on my own. Before high school, I never had to study for tests (except the SHSAT) and I had no idea how nor the work ethic to do so. I missed tons of school days, I was wasting money on taxicabs to get to school 5 minutes late instead of 30, etc. At some point, I started faking illness to get out of school for extended periods of time. At first it was exaggerating real sickness, but then it became outright making things up. I was absent for two 2-week periods, which piled up massive amounts of work on me and formed a barrage of ""wtf where did you go"" questions from my classmates, which I had no real answer to except to feel ashamed. 

A little more than halfway through the year, I had what I call a nervous breakdown. I know it's not a medical definition, but I don't know what else to call it. I stopped going to school altogether, and my parents stopped punishing me for it. I was extremely irritable and I would have massive mood swings. I broke furniture, yelled, etc. I would cry constantly. This lasted for a couple weeks, and then I mellowed down a little. Now, the Board of Education was involved and wondering what's going on. Initially, they send homeschooling teachers to our apartment but I refused to work with them. I would curl up and not respond to anything they said, so my dad would just talk to them and plan out what to do. Eventually we got them to stop sending teachers and legally made me a home schooled student. 

During this whole time, I was feeling inadequate in every way. I essentially dropped out of high school with relatively poor grades and I behaved like a shithead to my parents. 

Over the next couple of years I would spend most of my time sitting in my room on my computer. For a year and a half or so, I really hated going outside, which meant that I missed lots of psychiatrist and therapist appointments. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and clinical depression during this time. 

During that year, my parents were getting desperate about what to do so they started bringing me into hospital emergency rooms so a psychologist would be forced to see me. However, one time this backfired terribly. I was in an emergency room and some doctor interviewed me, asking some basic questions. Apparently this doctor deemed me a suicide risk even though I have never attempted suicide, and the hospital wanted to keep me in their psych ward for the night. My parents agreed because they were scared, so at 4 in the morning (we arrived at sometime in the evening) I was brought from an emergency room bed to the psych ward, exhausted. They woke me up sometime in the morning after I had gotten 3 hours of sleep and sent me in front of a panel of doctors who asked a few questions and then sent me back to my jail cell of a room 5 minutes later. Apparently I said something wrong, because they extended the time they wanted me there from a night to a week. 

Hospital psych wards, or at least that one, are very similar to prisons in both facilities and treatment of inmates. I was in an adolescent / child ward, so we weren't restrained or anything, but we couldn't bring in anything from the outside during our allotted parental visits, we were placed in barely furnished locked rooms, and worst of all, treated by the staff as if we were criminals and that this was a punishment (which I guess it was). Finally, after wrestling and dealing with essentially extortion from the hospital (they said if my parents removed me against the doctor's advice they would no longer be required to treat us) I got out. About six months after that mess, the hospital was bankrupt. I felt pretty bad, because I was born in that hospital.

Anyway, life continued as essentially the same for the next couple of years, from 10th to where I am now, 12th grade. I've been getting better and going out a lot more than I was a couple years ago, and I see my friends regularly. However, my depression was at its worst these last couple of years and I came as close to attempting suicide as I ever have. The worst thing about it, though, is its persistence and how my teenage years have essentially been wasted. While everyone else is going to school, meeting people, hanging out, dating, etc I'm at home reading all kinds of articles and gaming at four in the morning, sometimes randomly tearing up. Often, I feel as if I have no right to be where I am because people who have dealt with far worse than I have have done much better with their lives. 

I'm currently preparing for college (I'm in 12th grade but I'm taking a gap year so I'll be applying in the fall). I've just taken my SATs (don't have my score yet but I got a 2200 on my last practice) and I have lots of tutors coming, courtesy of my parents' time and money. (While my reading as kept me up with a lot of stuff, I'm still behind in things, most importantly math. We're cramming two years of it into a semester, which has gone well so far) I'm working on building a portfolio because I have no GPA, and I want to go to a top-tier college (a man can dream...). I'll probably do non-degree courses at a public college in the extra year I have, so I have more of a chance. 

Anyway, I wrote about 100x more than I probably should've, but here's my problem: what do I do if this happens again in college? I don't feel like anything has profoundly changed in myself and I'm only just barely getting back on my feet after four years. I'm extremely anxious and I have no idea what to do. My parents don't know that I'm still as depressed as I am because I'm too ashamed to tell them, and I don't know what'll happen if all of the time and energy they spent getting me to college is wasted by me.

This makes a lot more sense to me, which is why I always felt someone should have a real diagnosis first.  However, I think everyone I know on meds was started with them from their GP, and then maybe they move to a psychiatrist and get an official diagnosis. Many don't, and I don't see how a GP has enough experience in this specific field to be able to tell someone with extreme depressive disorders versus someone who is bummed because their dog died.  They are going to say they have never felt happy, get a trial of some med, and be sent on their way.

For me, with all the side effects, it has to be worth it, does the fix you get somehow make your life better than dealing with all the side effects? In my case, no, they never were.  However, I certainly have a diagnosable and needing treatment type of depression.  So far, most of what I try has made things far more worse, and that which hasn't, has made me near too good, and feeling euphoric and high, or did nothing but make me feel out of it with a ton of terrible side effects.

Surprise! I relapsed, attempted suicide and very nearly succeeded.  After a bit in the hospital and an inpatient facility near by I'm out and getting ready to start taking my new medicines (I was on them for three days in the hospital along with another heavy duty mood stabilizer to numb the SI and Self Harm thoughts) but I haven't had them for 2 days now.  So really, I haven't had a chance to take more than just a bit and really get into the side effects.  Plus I was drugged up a good majority of the time while they worked on my treatment.

Seroquel, Trilepta, Abilify (or another anti-pyschotic if my insurance refuses to pay for the abilify), and Vistaril for anxiety.  The vistaril is temporary until I can prove to them I won't overdose again or attempt to abuse my drugs, then we'll switch to ativan or valium.  

Has anyone been on the Serquel, Trilepta, Abilify combo, or a similar one?  What was life like?  I was on a high dose of Lithium in the hospital and I asked to be taken off of it because it made me feel like I was swimming through jello, everything that they talked to me about had to be explained 10 times and that's very unusual.  The doctor still wants to put me on lithium but thankfully my WBC has been high and the short time in the hospital shot it up super high.  

I've asked my therapist and both psychiatrists and they all tell me no side effects that would be debilitating or annoying.  But they also told me the same thing for my Lithium (not true) and my topomax which I also used to be on.

We're 3 days away from my 20th birthday and I failed, once again.

I already had a girlfriend about 2 years ago. A girl that I loved deeply but, it ended for some reasons. I failed for the first time, and it hurt. Of course I didn't take it well. Tried to end it with the shitty life I had at the time, twice. As you can see, it didn't worked, second time I failed. I was going through some anxiety crisis.


I decided to drop college (which I was failing anyways for obvious reasons) and moved to my dad's house. I wanted to start over. I did get a new job and went to the technical school. 


Everything went okay for about a year until something called love came in the play. I fell in love with one of my coworkers, not that kind of love that gets away after a week. She is pretty, smart and has a wonderful smile. I did find the balls to ask her out. But it looks like I timed it badly. In fact, I asked her out about 3 days after her boyfriend left her. So obviously it didn't work and I was pretty sure she was upset because I was a complete retard to ask her out only few days after her ex left. I did another anxiety crisis, thus failing once again, IMO.


Then, about a month ago, I started talking with her a lot more than usual and I never seem like I was boring her. And yeah, despite all I was saying, I was still loving her, more than ever. That time I took the time to talk to one of her friends about me asking her out for a dinner. I wanted to know if: 1. She was still single and, 2. If she was dating/seeing other people. I didn't wanted to ask her out if she was already dating someone because I didn't feel I could pull her out from somebody else. But no, her friend told me that she was single and not seeing anyone. So I asked her out.


She said that she would go to the restaurant with me. I was so happy to finally got a yes from her. I was waiting for this for so long. But when I asked her when she was free, I didnt really get something clear. She told me that she's very busy at the moment and cannot really got out and that she will text me when she will be less busy. That, literally crushed me. I was *that* close from my goal. And it looked like I was disturbing her so I texted her something like okay, Have a good night.

One part of myself is saying: Hey! That's cool, she will text you when she will want to go out and you should not worry much.

But the other one is saying: Meh, she won't write you back. She wrote you that so you don't really feel bad. You failed, again.

Here we are, may 7th, stuck in that dilemma, not feeling to good. I don't really know how to react. I could use some advices.

Thanks.

We're not ""broken"" people and need to be fixed with pharmaceuticals, we are normal people who have a terrible illness that needs to be treated with medication.

I would consider talking to your prescriber if you're still feeling this way on your meds.  In addition to upping the dose, there are many other meds that may work better for you.  Most important thing to remember - you don't have to live like this.  You have options.  It's hard, but if you reach out a hand to your therapist/prescriber, they will help you.

Once you can get the depression under control, you will find it significantly easier to deal with the day-to-day bullshit in your life.  Just don't wait too long.  Get this taken care of now.

I'm having a very hard time coping, and seem to be showing many signs of depression. Id really just like some advice on this, as I haven't dealt with it for many years and never with the stress of a job and schoolwork at the same time. I have been seeing a therapist for about a month now but it has been 2 weeks since our last appointment due to me being ill. She believes I have GAD because of my low self esteem and obsessive worrying.

Some background, I come for a fairly broken home, my mother has always been my saving grace though. My dad has borderline personality disorder, and was in and out of prison for all my life. The biggest offence was he stabbed someone (when I was 14) He would ring me from cells crying and begging me to help him, and this period of my life was the worst thing I have ever gone through. From the ages of 10-15 I was a completely different person. I haven't seen him since I was 15 (through my choice). 

I stopped attending school when I was 14, I hated it and thought Id be happier learning in an environment I didnt despises and fear. I went to a tutor my school sorted 3 times a week and self learnt the rest of the time. Did not socialise with anyone my own age for a number of years. I finished my final exams (mandatory school finishes at 16 in england) and started a normal college with other people, and really blossomed. Became social, people liked me, got a boyfriend etc.

After leaving college I was out of work for a year, and during this time I was fairly low mood wise. Through most of it my boyfriend had a full time job so I would just spend my time in my room or out with friends if they were home from university. It was boring, but my anxiety was never high and I was comfortable.

At some point I decided I should probably be an adult and get a job, so I did. Its full time and I get paid £2.54 (4.16$) an hour. Everyone is really nice to me and I havent been treated badly at all, but Im not doing exactly what the job advertised and after 5 months it is starting to really effect my mental health. My personal hygiene has dropped to an all time low - I regularly go 5/6 days without showering and my room is usually disgusting. I find myself putting things off almost indefinitely, I wait and wait to do something but cant muster the energy or spirit to do it and the opportunity passes. Getting out of the house in the mornings is always a struggle. Its effecting my work and my bad planning has been brought up by my boss.

Im honestly starting to feel as low as I did when all the previously mentioned stuff happened with my father. I basically feel trapped, as this is an internship and I have college work to do along side it (I was given this work almost a month ago and have still not even looked at it, I dont know why) which lasts a year. I also have responsibilities here and Id feel bad leaving when everyone's been so lovely.

My ideal situation is to have a part time job (no more than 25 hours a week) and do other things along side (Streaming on twitch, making jewellery, writing, all things I find self soothing and pleasurable). I would actually be making around £100 more a month if I did this. On the other hand I wonder if Im just running away from this like I have run from all the big responsibilities in my life.

I started struggling with depression sometime in the last 3-5 years ago (I think a bad break up is what kicked it off, but that was really only a catalyst, not necessarily a cause).  I started treatment a few years ago (meds, specifically settled on wellbutrin), but in the summer of 2012, I started going to art school an hour away from home, and less than a week after moving, I had a really bad skateboarding accident.  I had just bought a new pre-built cruiser and I hadn't tightened the trucks to how I like them yet.  I was skating back from kroger a block away, and the parking lot had like a 35-40 degree sloped outlet that went down into the side street, and I got the speed wobbles on my way down and ended up falling trying to make the turn, and it rung my bell pretty good.  I ended up with a concussion, but I didn't realize it because the way my skull had fractured helped relieve the pressure in my brain (the fracture was above my right ear, and the neurologist said my skull ""popped along the seam like a ping pong ball""), and instead thought I had just had a bad fall, so I walked back to my apartment and fell asleep for 3 1/2 HOURS.  I ended up going to the ER when I woke up, and it took me about a month of recovery before I was cleared to go back to school.

Here's where shit started to get really tough: I've smoked weed since almost a year before moving, and had been a daily smoker since the first bag I ever bought.  This was a couple months before starting my treatment, and I'm a lot more aware of the link between weed and depression now, but back then, despite smoking every day, I still felt well adjusted, and I was coping, and had a social life, and just wasn't really held back by depression that much besides just getting more and more emotionally numb as time went on.  Anyway, after the accident, I of course continued to smoke (in addition to my small prescription of norcos), and my use increased more and more.  Things were totally different after the accident, my anxiety was through the roof when I had never really had that much of an issue with anxiety before, I wasn't as sharp as I was before, I stumble over my words and have trouble putting sentences together.  I just in no way felt like myself, and I kept smoking because it was the only thing that made me feel much of anything besides oppressing depression and all the accompanying negative, irrational emotions.  I smoked when I woke up, I smoked before I left for class, I smoked on the 30 minute breaks of my four hour classes, I smoked when I got home, and then I'd hit my friends up and we'd listen to records and smoke, and then I'd go home and smoke before I went to bed so I'd actually be tired.  I smoked when we skated, I smoked in the middle of trips to the mall, I smoked on the way back from the grocery store, I wouldn't even show up to concerts until the headliner came on, maybe the last opening band, because I didn't want to be sober when the band I wanted to see was on.  Not trying to sound like a pothead dr seuss, it's just not an exaggeration whatsoever when I say that weed was (and still is) so integral to my identity as a person, and when I failed out of school almost a year after my accident, I came home and kept the same habits.  Except by then my mom's stoner boyfriend had moved in, and between him and I, my mom started smoking too.  So now instead of doing this thing that I had to hide and hit up friends just to be able to do, I live in a stoner household.  Our entire lifestyle is weed, and I can't do it anymore. 

My stepdad is a paramedic/EMT, and is capable of balancing weed with his professional life.  My mom is pretty capable of it too, although she's aware of any and all impact weed has on her life outside of the time she spends smoking too.  Me, on the other hand, I can't smoke weed like this anymore.  I've had one job in the 20 months I've been back at home, I was a security guard for 4 months or so and the only reason I even took it was because it paid $10.50 an hour and I could bring my one hitter and smoke on the job whenever I wanted to.  Obviously it's not a simple thing to quit smoking when other people you live with have the exact same lifestyle you're trying to give up, but I'm not going to ask them to quit.  We talked about turning the spare bedroom into a kind of den/smoke room so I wouldn't have to be around it in the living room, but at this point I think it would just be a lot easier to stay with my dad a little over an hour away, he works 60 hour weeks so I'd probably be a lot more lonely than I am now, but it would be a healthier place for me, at least until I can lose my dependency.

The part that really fucks with me though is that I know how bad I want to quit smoking, but I can't seem to just make it happen.  I know I have a dependency and not an addiction, but withdrawal scares me so much, I can't even go a few hours of being sober at the house by myself because I feel so terrible and I'm always aware that there's a half ounce in the house and all I have to do is grind some up and load a bowl.  And weed takes a long time to work out of your system, one month is always the rule of thumb but I've had friends who smoke as much as I do tell me it was closer to two months.  It stores in your fat cells, and when you detox, it exits through your blood stream, still as a cannabinoid, which means you still kind of get that stoned feeling while it's working it's way out of your system, and still interferes with your sleep schedule, appetite, serotonin levels, etc.  The thought of it fills me with dread, even though I know it's the right thing to do.  I tried using /r/leaves for support, but considering I'm still around it, stopping cold turkey was nearly impossible, and so I was just trying to cut my consumption down and spend a lot more time sober, but tapering is against the rules of the sub, so until I start staying with my dad, I can't really use it as much of a resource.  Plus nobody can make a change until they're totally ready and wanting it, and I'm still so fearful about quitting that I'm constantly plagued with doubt, second thoughts, and ""what's the point""s.

I know that continuing to smoke weed is continuing to hold me back, and it's been a lot more present of a thought since I started reading more about how weed inhibits serotonin production in the body, but it's such a part of who I am, and I'm afraid of giving up such a huge part of myself.  My mom smoking has brought us a lot closer together, my two best friends smoke about as much as I do, and that's a big part of our relationship.  I'm afraid that removing the bad things in my life will also remove the good, and I know that there's always happiness to be found in life no matter what you lose, but I'm afraid of losing myself completely and not getting to keep the positive things that I've actually worked for.  Which sounds kind of silly now that I'm reading it so I can't even imagine how silly it looks to you guys, but I've been dealing with depression for so long now that even though I'm optimistic in the long run, I have zero confidence in myself when it comes to short-term goals, and I'm in such a rut that I can't even enjoy working on music.  I'm a producer so a lot of what I do is listen to a loop of whatever I'm working on, while I adjust parameters like EQ, compression, and reverb.  I used to lose myself in whatever I worked on, but now the repetitive nature of my workflow feels totally overbearing and I get so demotivated after just a 30 minute session, whether technical or creative.  Between that and strategy games like Factorio and Space Engineers where all of my downtime in the game is spent planning or troubleshooting a previous plan, I used to have more than enough to at least keep my mind occupied and away from some self-loathing loop of emotions and thought, but now it all just leaves me with the same empty feeling I wake up to every morning, and go to bed with every night.  It's just so confusing to me because my depression was always about never knowing what step to take next, but now I know what I need to do.  I need to quit smoking weed so I can learn to be sober and still cope with the day-to-day, so I can get a job and eventually get into an audio engineering program.  But I'm still stationary, I'm aware of the good that will come from my change, but I'm still afraid to do it.  And it's a new kind of fear, because it's not a fear of the unknown like I'm used to, it's a fear of the known, and that scares me even more.  I just can't get behind myself when I know I'm ready for positive changes, even when all I want is a positive outlook/mindset, and it's frustrating and confusing and scary and just soul-crushing in general.

I'm sorry if this was a bitch to read, this is about the most effort I've made recently to try to put my emotions into words and I still can't tell which concerns are valid and which are just some kind of subconscious attempt to rationalize the way I feel.  Can anyone relate to the way I'm feeling right now though?  I know that might be a silly question for this particular sub, and I feel kind of bad that I can't really come up with a question or specific area where I need support.

Its a program similar to outward programs, but with more emphasis on outdoor skills.

I guess it was kind of my fault, because I did not have the right mindset during preseason. I thought I was going to make it the entire time, just because I was a senior. I was the captain of JV last year and started every game. I joined the extra curricular club that the coach is the head of as a freshman. Even though I thought I would make it, I never really thought I was good enough too. I was always worried about playing badly, where as last year It was get mad that you messed up, not forget about it and try and do better next time. I defiantly was good enough, comparing my self to some other players that made it. Some kids from my spring team who never played made it, while I got cut and was the go to guy the other team. 

I think a big part of the reason I am unhappy is becaue I dont do work. Just working out and actually doing homework has helped my mood a lot, and motivated me to keep going. College is still 7 months away, and I have all that time to better myself. If I keep going at the pace i'm going by the time it comes I will be happy with who I am.

If I don't go, the judgment from my friends parents and peers will set me back a lot. If I got in and differed, that would probably be okay though.

Mostly weed. I got kinda addicted to methaphetimens for a while, but havent used them in 6 or 7 months. I use alcohol occasional, but the use is typically social in nature.

I think that last paragraph rings so true. So true. I try and make myself stay away from relationships. It is tough for me to watch a girl that is ideal of a high school girlfriend in almost every way, shes pretty smart, funny and just fun to be around chase after a kid that I guess I would say is my friend. 

It is even tougher to watch my former best friend (hes a pot head and a dick) be extremely happy with the girl I like. Especially because I know she could do wayyy better then him.

The attacks increased in frequency until I squelched them under a prescribed dose of Celexa; now I only have them in response to very stressful situations, and it takes kind of a lot to stress me out to this point. I'm not all better, but going down to ""only when triggered by a clear cause"" from ""a least once a week whether I needed one or not"" is a fine improvement. I'm also not often wracked by a debilitating sense of guilt and shame, which *was* constant and made my anxiety that much more triggerable.

But the trigger of my current anxiety attack isn't even what's really bothering me anymore; what's bothering me is that even though the problem that caused the attack has been more-or-less resolved, I'm still clogged up with all these emotions and I don't feel like I can let them out. I want to do something expressive, like a very detailed drawing or a long piece of writing, but I'm afraid to because I'm afraid someone will see (there's that old guilt and shame again), even if the content created by my ""outlet"" has nothing to do with my actual emotions. I feel like whoever views my creation will somehow *know* that it was fueled by all this negative energy I have pent up, and then they'll be able to see into this dark part of my life, which I can't stand to let anyone else see. I can't even make something creative and then not show it to anyone, lest someone see me at work on it and surmise that I'm being creative for a *reason.*

I have plenty of artistic talent, but because of this sense of shyness and shame, I'm afraid to channel it into anything that isn't strictly practical - character sketches for someone else's RP, costume orders for my patrons or altering my new work clothes, or even this post. I wouldn't even be typing this out if it didn't describe an interesting new symptom, or an interesting new angle on a symptom, that could help me shed light on my disease. I wouldn't dare post it, but I'd like to hear from the community if this is a ""normal"" symptom or if it's something specific to me, because that will probably help in my eventual therapy or something (sure wish that doc would call me back...).

I mean, of course it's a normal symptom; it's a natural extension of my pervasive shame, which is a normal symptom as far as I know. But, since I already bothered to hide under the covers with my phone and type all this out (which helped, btw; thanks!), does anyone else..?


**Tl;dr:** DAE feel like being creative could help their anxiety, but you don't create anything because you're afraid to let anyone see evidence of you needing to be expressive?

I still haven't figured out where that might come from, if I ever find out I will keep you informed.

I hope you feel better, have a nice day !

And like I mentioned, it doesn't even matter if you care or think they're true or interesting or anything... just say them. Look at yourself in a mirror and say ""I got pretty damn decent grades in high school, and I am sure I could do that again if I tried."" Again, don't care if it's true. Seriously. Just say it. Come up with other things. Don't care if they're fabricated lies, don't care if you are actually describing someone else -- just say them. Give it some time. I promise, it actually does make a difference.

With the counselor thing, I would still suggest you try again. It often takes many tries to find the right system that works for you. Not all counselors are the same -- not only are there lots of different methods used by counselors and therapists, but each person is, well, a person - you may or may not click with their personality or something like that.

I don't have statistics on it, but I remember recently reading that the average time it takes for a diagnosis of something like bipolar disorder is over five years. It takes a lot of time to both find someone to work with, and iron out what the possible issues could be. Even if you are not looking for a diagnosis, the same thing applies -- you can't treat it overnight. Keep looking, and keep trying. If you don't click with someone after a few sessions, let them know and ask for a referral. The counselors also know that there isn't a one-size-fits-all, and I'm sure they'd totally understand if you wanted another perspective.

Also, don't discount the possibility of a psychiatrist, too. Although most people recommend that counseling should make up a big part of your treatment plan, medication can be a vital part to addressing underlying issues of chemical balance that hinder your progress. Talk to a counselor or your PCP for information about psychiatric medication or a referral to a psychiatrist, if you think that is a factor you need to deal with.

Also, keep in mind that the years between your teens and twenties are, socially and physiologically, chock full of changes. You may have felt well-adjusted as a teen and recently found yourself struggling to make meaning out of your life, and that is perfectly normal. These changes can be a result of chemical/hormonal imbalances or big life changes like moving away from home, going to college, or getting a job. It's not a bad thing, but it just sometimes happens that people don't react as well to those issues, and things like depression can result. Just because it's a more recent development doesn't mean ""it's a phase"" or it's any less real or valid.",,0.0,,2012-12-07 20:49:41,,,0,False,,,,0,,c7cvvq8,,,,,t3_14g4nf,,,t1_c7cvvq8,,,,t1_c7cvmty,,,,,,,,1430608308.0,,6,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,6,,

You kind of hit a button for me when you said that you don't want to die, because I don't either. That one thought alone keeps the thoughts as just thoughts and makes me continue to fight it. 

Change in a relationship is hard, especially when it's the other person who's changing so much and you feel like you either A) can't be a part of it or B) aren't comfortable with it. And it's tough when you're trying to change things in yourself for the better and his changes are distracting you from making your own.

I just wanted to share that because I think you can relate and I want you to know that you're not alone. 

Fighting for relationships is hard, but maybe we need to fight for ourselves first?

**Backstory:**         
I graduated from High School as a sophomore. I don't need to explain to anyone here that high school sucks ass; Particularly for the depressed / socially anxious teenage mind. I'm currently in my second semester at a community college here in town, and school is fine. I'm able to get by with tolerable amounts of stress, and never have to talk to anybody, so it works out nicely.   
    I don't need to explain my whole life story, you just need to understand that I don't interact with real people, in real life, ever. I just go to school, work, sleep, repeat. I have poor eating and sleeping habits, and am often barely kept functional by a host of medication.    

**Backstory** **tl;dr:** I'm not doing so great (from a subjective, emotional standpoint), and am (comfortably) lonely.    

Now for my problem / question.    

I guarantee that if I didn't have video games, I would not be alive. I would have offed myself years ago. They are the only thing that I can look forward to in life. I daydream about getting all of my studies done, plopping down in front of my computer screen, and mindlessly playing a game for 10-12 hours. My only problem here, and I'm sure other gamers (although it is unlikely that many here play as much as I do) will understand, but playing alone is a drag. For me, the physical boundary between persons in a digital interface surpasses my need for introversion, and I am put off by playing alone.    

 I have one 'friend' that I play with regularly. We'll call him Max. I went to high school with Max, and knew him very little in person. I ate lunch alone.    

Max, in short, is an ass. He is genuinely everything that is bad in a 'friend'. He is self-absorbed, absent minded, inebriated, insensitive, and apathetic 90% of the time. We usually talk over a VoIP program (like Skype or Teamspeak), which makes it hard for me to just ""hang up"" or ""walk away"". 
   
I am the kind of person that feels guilty about everything (to the point where if I accidentally cut someone off on the highway, my entire day is officially ruined.) The guilt play an imperative role in my problem, the problem being made up of two parts:  

**First:** Max is terrible for me. He brings me down, is demoralizing, and is a generally belligerent 'friend'. I can't find it in myself to cut ties with him, as he is the only person I know of who can / will play games with me. I am in a constant tug-of-war between a) the loneliness of playing alone, and b) the perks of playing with Max, but the chance of being crippled and scarred emotionally (which happens regularly).    
    
Now, the obvious answer here is to ""just stop talking / playing with him!"" Believe me, I wish it was that easy. I KNOW he isn't my friend, and I know that it is better for me in the long run to just end it with him, but I can't bring myself to call it.    

**Second:** I empathize too severely; I am too considerate where no empathy is appropiate. If I stopped all communication and interaction with Max, I would *feel bad* for him. I wouldn't be able to live with the idea that he likely hates me / doesn't like me. He would likely talk poorly about me to his millions of other 'friends', whom I shouldn't even care about, but somehow do (I don't even know/talk/see anybody besides Max *ever*.) It's just my self-destructive, masochistic hemartia that I can't seem to get over.    

I don't really know how to handle this, and either way is going to hurt. I know I'm not going to find any solutions (at least, easy ones) here, but I am trying to learn to look out for myself; I needed to come here to seek help, or else I would feel bad about that too. If you actually came this far, congratulations: You've wasted a good five minutes of your life hearing some other pointless, nihilistic crap that you probably read every time you come to /r/Depression. At the same time, thanks.

Psychologists call this IPD or Immediate Problematic Dissolution, it's when in the act of suicide of which there is literally no return the vast majority of reports, no matter how determined the victim is, end up in the middle of the act of suicide having all their problems dissolve to apparent nothingness in comparison to the enormity of the death, this may sound peaceful but it only occurs because the problem of death so vastly outweighs any others so the terror experienced by those mid fall far outweighs any problem ever experienced, having a knife held to our throat is nothing compared to falling with a guarantee of death in less time to think anything other than horrid screaming.

If you're going to end your life, do it on your 100% sober terms and remember you can always skip town and start fresh, disappearing is easier for family and friends than a suicide. Hell you might even reconsider, but please don't do it now, it's a silly mistake and you don't want to stuff up a suicide, even with a gun at the last second it can be angled wrong and you'll live in a state not worth living.

I apologise for the wall of text.

 I wake up, go take a shower, my dad bangs on the door telling me my 5 minutes is up (we don't have any problems with bills, and I wake up early) and I go get dressed in the usual: T-shirt, pants, and my favorite sweatshirt. I eat breakfast, my dad still yelling at me to hurry up meanwhile my younger brother is just getting out of bed. I finish eating, pack my things for school, and start walking to school where I'll get there 30 minutes early sitting in the library wondering when Ill get out of this godawful place (referring to America, I plan to get a job after high school, save money, and move someplace in England).

Then the bell rings, I continue through 1st, 2nd, and 3rd period, thinking how everybody is looking at my hair, saying it looks weird, scanning my face because it looks ugly. Sometimes they think I'm the weirdest kid in the school. Then 4th period comes, Physical Education.. great. I go into the locker room, the horrible stench of sweaty and fat middle-class American boys filling my nostrils. I put my backpack in my locker, and go sit in the gym waiting for everyone to dress down. I don't dress because I'm too self-conscious of my body, another day of getting my points docked down for the class. Another year of P.E. failed. The whole class, I walk on the track passing by girls that didn't dress down. When I'm coming behind them.. do they think I'm a perv that just looks at their asses? Do other people think that, too?

Okay, just look up off the ground now, looking just above their shoulders. Crap, do people think I'm gay now (I am not opposed to any gay rights or have a problem with the gay community, it's just this is high school, you know) because I'm not taking the chance to check these girls out? I'm not gay, please oh please don't make fun of me. Finally, P.E. is over, I grab my backpack from my locker and go to lunch. I still haven't gotten money from my parents for lunch yet, and besides, I'm still grounded from the computer (typing this on my old iPod) so I have to do schoolwork on the school computers anyways. Another day of going home starving. The 5th period bell rings, English class, the boring type. I just sleep through it again, get the assignment and off I go to 6th and 7th period after the bell rings.

School's finally out. I go home and eat my ""lunch"" and watch TV. I hear the door unlock a few minutes later. Mom is here, fan-fucking-tastic. Immediately she goes on and on about how I don't help around the house and she doesn't have time to clean up my messes (I don't usually clean up and help, but when I do she makes a fit how I did it wrong and how I won't be able to live by myself, and after seeing a couple things here on reddit, I'm sure husbands can relate to this). Then she proceeds to tell me to get ready to go to the therapist, doctor, whatever. 

We get there and it's the usual. My therapist asks me how I feel, what I think, etc.. I tell the same thing again because I'm 15 and my mother needs to be in the room. Now I can't vent because I hate my mom and she doesn't even care for me, I feel UNCOMFORTABLE around her. Now you're thinking ""don't think like that, she loves you, she's your mother"". This bitch could give a shit less how I feel. The day she got me tested for depression, she couldn't handle how her ""little angel"" had such thoughts of suicide and social anxiety... for an hour. This is also why I'd rather vent to people I don't even know, or people on a minecraft server I've been on for only 2 years. 

Anyways it's over and we're on our way home and my mom is saying how the prayers (she's a strong Jehovah's Witness, I'm an agnostic atheist and hate the religion (but that's another story) and the meetings and such are torture for me) are working. Going on and on ""proving"" to me (mind you, I said agnostic atheist, I believe that there is a chance a god exists, just not theirs) how Jehovah exists and if I keep praying to him ill be resurrected in the new system. This goes on for the 30 minute drive home whilst I'm just thinking ""bullshit"" over and over. Also, this is a daily occurrence because they (my family) obviously don't respect my beliefs and preach to me every day, because to them ""agnostic atheist"" just means ""atheist"" (also, I have ""been"" an atheist before, I looked into my feelings more and found my real faith, and yes I have explained to them my newfound beliefs but they brushed it off as ""still a god hating atheist"").

When I get home I eat dinner whilst the pigs talk about their wonderful day that Jehovah gave them, rubbing their happiness in my face. Then I finish and I go to bed, I want nothing to do with these people and just want to get out. I sit in bed watching YouTube on my iPod for 2 hours or so when it dies. It's around 8:30 to 9:00 PM, so I sit in bed having thoughts till I go to sleep. 

I think how good it will be just to get out of this place. What if I commited suicide? It would be all over, it would be fantastic, and also fantastic for my family to blame themselves for driving me to it. But then what about my real friends? My few friends I have in real life? What about my friends on that Minecraft server? They'd all be devastated to know I died. I'll endure for their sake. I don't want them to be sad like I've been these past years. And then I fall asleep.

Just one more day for them..

Some symptoms I had for Depression (which are usually common) are:

* Loss of interest in activities that were enjoyable
* Fatigue/aches and pains
* Not as outgoing
* Emotions are harder to feel
* Feelings of loneliness/emptiness
* Increase in anxiety
* No motivation
* Suicidal thoughts/Thoughts of death

These aren't the only symptoms, and most people experience depression differently, but with similar feelings.  If you really feel like it's a possibility don't hesitate to go see a doctor.  Depression is a lot easier to fight with friends and family, so if you can, talk to your best friend.  You're also in the age range (teenagers) when depression usually starts to develop.

Erm, this is my first time posting here and I'm not usually good at these things but I honestly just need some support and to get this off my chest I guess.
 

Ever since middle school I've suspected that I am depressed. The symptoms (?) have gotten worse over the years. The numbness, the aches, exhaustion, everything has gotten worse and I can't deal with it anymore. I want to cry, I need to cry, I can feel my eyes aching but I just can't. I feel like I'm going mad, and I want it to end so badly, I want to kill myself but the thought of it not going right for example scares me, it makes me even more upset. My head aches with all this shit, and I don't feel comfortable telling anybody apart from you lot, I know you understand me and that helps a lot. 

I've had councling over the summer which I thought was going well but after I left it got worse again, worse than it was before I started councling. It doesn't help that I've cut all but 2 ""friends"" off since I left upper school, but at the moment that's the last thing on my mind. The thought of friends just pisses me off, why do we need them? They have never helped me, why does everyone want to be so popular?! 

I don't really know where I'm going with this, and I have loads more to talk about, but I just want someone to talk to or some help, someone who understands. Sorry for this post.

I grew some pretty intense feelings for her and she told me she liked me too. A few years later I moved and I tried calling her and she told me she wanted nothing to do with me. I was so sure about her and I too. I based everything off of her. I felt so shitty about myself at that time. I don't feel so awful about what happened now but it still does hurt. I'm not saying there is some magic cure that will make you all of a sudden happy. (Trust me I looked into it.) But my advice for you is to not give up.

Basically what I'm curious about, is if anyone has experience with taking Zoloft (Sertraline) along with Seraquil (Quetiapine)? 5 weeks ago, I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft. At first it seemed to help a lot, after the initial week of overwhelming sleepiness, but then quickly took a nosedive due to insomnia. I couldn't even tell you if I was feeling better from the Zoloft, because I was so damn tired all the time from not sleeping. Today, I was prescribed 25mg Seraquil to take as needed for insomnia. As with the Zoloft, before taking it I wanted to read up everything I could on it. 

And due to it being primarily prescribed for Bipolar and Schizophrenia, I have hardly at all been able to find anything information on what I may experience. How it might affect me along with taking the Zoloft in the morning. Because I am not Bipolar. Or Schizophrenic. And even when I do find someone with just depression who relate their experiences on both, they are also on several other medications along with it, or are taking hundreds of mg's of both, or have a severe anxiety issue. I don't have anxiety. I find it infuriatingly difficult to find much information or any relatable information for people who don't have severe anxiety or aren't taking huge doses of these things. All the side effects and things I'm finding are everything about it's affected their anxiety, and someone's 400mg dose of Seraquil is not going to tell me a comparable experience to my 25mg dose. 

Like, I'm super thrilled that there's so many resources for those with Anxiety. Truly. But I want to bang my head against the wall because I don't have that and am desperate to find *something* about taking lower doses of these things as I am, without the main condition being anxiety, or bipolar disorder. It is becoming akin to confirmation bias, all I can see is the word anxiety everywhere and I'm starting to feel like the only person on the planet who just has plain depression and that *nobody* can relate to me. 

Don't get me wrong. I am extremely grateful I don't have anxiety. It's just that I do have something wrong too, and after hours of trying to find information for someone who has depression and is taking similar medication to me is feeling fucking nonexistant and I want to pull my hair out. 

*Also, everything I've read about has talked about withdraws from Seraquil...but I was told to take them ""as needed"". I don't understand how I could just take them sometimes but not suffer withdraw symptoms the times I don't. Couldn't find anything out about that either.

It is not normal for people to have these types of thoughts and at least for myself I am striving to be more normal. Cutting can be seen as an addiction. As you are probably already aware, when you cut it releases endorphins which is why it feels good to cut. For me, my depression got so bad that I was entirely numb. I cut just to feel something.

I'm 17, and was depressed since I was about 13. My parents divorced 3 years ago and mom left. He became a drunk. He always did drink, but never came home drunk.

My brother is the on in my family everybody knows and talks about. He leads an acting group, is alwaysin the news, radio, and what not. I have an extensive family, and not one person in there really likes me.

But I can't call them a family, can I? For me family isn't blood. You have to earn that.

I never had friends. Not until I was 13. Way too late. By then I was scared. I don't trust people, and I always put on a fake smile. I want to open, I do. But when I try, my brain shuts down and I can't do it. I can post it here because it's anonymus (technically).

These two friends of mine... I can't do it anymore. I want them gone so that they don't have to suffer. That's why lately I have been avoiding them.

I got a girlfriend. Sounds goodm right? I don't actually like her. I don't dislike her, just feel inidifferent to her. I was always a good talker and listener, and people generaly don' hate me. I think that's why she likes me.

In school I was always bullied. Since I can remember.

I dropped out of school because I just can't do it anymore. Putting on a smile and acting as if nothing happened. And when I tried to open up, they just shut me down.

I was addicted to mastrubation. For about a month. Then it just stopped feeling good. Like this endless void inside me consumed everything. Never tried drugs, and I don't like cigarettes and alcohol.

I tried to kill myself yesterday. I stood on the bridge, ready to jump. I was so close to doing it too. Then, just for a second, this wave of complete freedom washed over me.

I can't explain it. It was like every fiber in my body finally felt free. I was no longer a prisoner in my head (a whole other story, but no medical condition that would explain it - I have gone trough that). And I stepped down. Didn't meen to either. It was like something posessing me and preventing me from jumping.

I can't cut my wrists, hang ,yself or do pills. I have no gun. I tried everything I could think off. And every time it was the  same.

I met my boyfriend over a year ago and it was pretty much love at first sight. He seemed so happy and laid back, he had told me everything about his past and how unlucky he was with his last and only girlfriend (she cheated on him after two years and he had to pack up quit college and move back home and work a shitty cleaning job to make ends meet) he lived off £40 a week and this included rent, bills and food money, needless to say he racked up so much debt and he wasn't getting much work in. He only managed to get by because a friend paid off his debt and put him up in his house rent free. When we met work was still shit, but was starting to get better. Despite things getting better financially for him he still can't move out this pessamist frame of mind, even though I love him and tell him every day he thinks he's not worth it. For the year so far I thought that maybe he wasn't so sure about us and that why he would sometimes not speak to me or just generally seem sad and cut off, but he assures me he loves me and that he's happy in this relationship. 
I've racked my brain with all the options, we suffer from a dead bedroom sex maybe 3 times a month, but only if I send him a text first saying that I want sex that night. We live together btw. He will stay up after I go to bed and get up before I do (he has trouble sleeping, he can maybe get a few hours a night) He's not mean to me just very secluded. 
I've known for a while he's had depression and after confronting him about it he also agreed and said that he can't really explain it, but sometimes he just isn't happy, and he doesn't know why, he can't see the brighter side of stuff and it frustrates him that he doesn't understand why he feels like hopeless. I personally think he's still living in the frame of mind he was in before we met (money around the house has been right since ive had my hours cut at work and in the process of changing jobs) and he thinks that it's all going to go to shit. I've told him to go to the doctors and get help but he refuses to accept there's anything wrong and he's just going to deal with it by himself, I asked for him to tell me how he's feeling and to tell me what to do, but he said that he doesn't know. 
This morning he woke up and just got dressed and went downstairs, I can tell his mood isn't the best and I just don't know what to do. Do I act like I don't notice and speak to him all optimistically and positive. Do I leave him alone? I don't want this getting in the way of us, and I understand that this isn't his fault, but I just don't know how to handle it and approach it. It gets me down and upsets me a lot because it just feels like he doesn't care, but I don't ever tell him this because it won't help his mood considering he can't control it.

I'm not sure how much help this can be to you but my only suggestion would be to reach out and tell your story to other places, not just Reddit.

Your story could fall into the right hands, and you could get the help you deserve.

Every day she gives out $10,000 and a new car to some unfortunate family.

I feel like I need help.

For some time now, I've been feeling down periodically. I think it got to the current level about half a year ago, but the frequency has increased, so my mood is less stable now.

It feels like that oscillation is around some drastic collapse. I really would like some way to evade this breakdown. 
The worst days are when I fantasize (in a pretty self-indulgent way, imagining all the drama) about suicide (my favourite way: falling decapitation). Of course, that way of thinking about suicide might well mean that I don't actually want it, that I actually just want to be coddled and get some attention, but these are problems in themselves.

I'm really looking for ways to get out of this. Is this real depression, or am I just a crybaby? Do I need to find out what's causing it first, or is there a depression override switch? (I have some ideas, please ask if you'd like to know them.) Is it good for me to whine about my problems? There are two factors I can think of; first, maybe I need some sense of self-worth to feel happy, making it good; second, maybe I need to lower my reliance on others to keep up my self-worth, making it bad in the long term.

Sorry if the post was a bit incoherent. I'm confused by my moods, which is why this may all seem like I'm going through the teen-age, but I'm a bit too old for that now. Is there a requirement for healthy development that, when unfulfilled, can cause this?

A few years ago, I attempted suicide by firearm. I sat in a dark room with an already loaded pistol, and after a lot of crying and shaking, during which I had cocked the gun, I pushed it into my skull and pulled the trigger. I heard a clink and noticed that the bullet had ejected rather than enter the barrel properly, so I assume that it failed to fully cock because of my shaking hands. I just sat there for a moment in utter disbelief that the gun refused to kill me, then picked up the bullet and returned the gun to its original place so no one would suspect anything. I was in high school at the time, and since then (and to this day) I suffer from MDD as well as general anxiety which often manifests as obsessive-compulsive tendencies as well as fear. Ever since then, however, I have been living in a strange state (both on and off medication) of something really hard to describe. It's like that bullet took a part of me with it which made me orderly and normal. It's not that I stopped caring about things, I just became very impulsive and developed a don't-give-a-fuck attitude towards everything. The only comparison I can make is to the popular depiction of Nihilism where a void of purpose exists, and this makes it difficult to get out of bed every morning, much less care about a future where I just sit and let myself starve one day, although the feeling is nothing compared to what I felt before attempting suicide. I just move through time waiting for something to happen, even if it's just the most insignificant change in my life. Most recently, I dropped out of University life (was a freshman, and made the choice in a matter of weeks) in favor of moving half-way around the world, since my motivation was bouncing off the ground. Now I feel as if this is a permanent comatose that I can look forward to every morning.


This is in opposition to how I mostly felt before my attempt, which is the ""what the fuck?"" aspect. Before, I was in the worst psychological pain I thought a human being could ever feel. Now, I'm a pseudo-zombie (I really don't know what other word to use) and I have no explanation why, even with my limited psychology education. Is this a common occurrence? I've had other near-death experiences before, but I don't really think of them much, so I don't know if being a near-death experience is enough. So, yeah. I'm just gonna... step outside for now...

On another note, I always thought it odd how people could fail to kill themselves with a bullet to the head, but now I see how things could come out so wrong. Or right, if you prefer.

TL;DR: I had sex for a week straight with a blazing redhead and now I'm sitting in a burn ward waiting for skin grafts while that woman is giving birth to a grizzly bear. Should have gone with the less combustible blond, maybe?

Some background story; I am 17 and in my senior year of highschool. I attend online school making my connection to the outside world limited. I was pulled out of a private school In Freshman year, due to my mom being layed off, and with that I left the people I went to school with for the past 9 years behind. I only remained in conctact with one since then, and he's is my best friend. 

I only see my best friend once a month. It really like puts me in a bad state of depression if I don't have him come over, or I go to his house within a month. I haven't seen him in 2 1/2 months and things are getting worse. i got my college acceptance letter in the mail, I am getting a degree in engineering, and with that came a lot of over thinking. I become just stressed by thinking about all the what ifs. Also, I have to get all my homework done for the school year by May 29th. I have been handling it well, I'm about 2 weeks ahead in all courses, but when I recieved this in the mail I legitimately couldn't work. 

I am worried that with all of this on me I will break eventually. I feel like I will have some sort of panic attack or just a mere break down where I don't want to talk to anyone. The few things I enjoy in life, League of Legends Ranked 5's team and my girlfriend (long distance), but I do not want to hurt the people in my life by putting my issues on them... I feel really lost at the moment, and within the past few weeks I have barely got any sleep. I am sorry I just really needed to get this off my chest.

152009,,True,keeerazay,,,,"Hi MattArmes,

I think talking to your mom about it is a great idea. Opening up about how you feel can be very difficult, but it's always a good move and a good first step. If she has experienced depression herself she is probably going to understand.

What you're experiencing, depression, it's a certifiable medical illness. You've got to start thinking of it this way, that you're afflicted with a disease, that you're sick. If you were physically sick, you'd go to the doctor and take treatment to make you better. It shouldn't be any different with mental illness.

Depression is a serious disease. And like any disease, the earlier the intervention the better. Leaving it off for a while isn't going to do any good. The earlier you seek help for this the better.

I would advise telling your mom about it as early as possible and going to see a doctor. Tell him what you've been experiencing and how you've been feeling. He will be able to diagnose you and suggest treatment. The same goes for a therapist, would therapy really be all that bad? It's just there to support you, to help you feel better again.

With regards to medication, I don't know if you need it or not. But if you do, and if your doctor suggests it, I would take his advice. You would take medecine for your liver if you had a liver disease, it should be no different for your head. There's no way taking antidepressants will impede your future employment chances. 

Suicide is not a road you need to go down. It really isn't. I know it's hard to see it now. When you're depressed everything looks black. But what you don't see is that there is help there, you just have to reach out for it. You can get better. You can leave this dark period in the past. 

I know what it's like to be where you are. How everything looks hopeless and overwhelming. And it shouldn't be, because you don't have a bad life. But it is. Let me tell you that you can get through it. I did. There's no reason why you can't too. You can feel healthy and well again. You will feel so good and you'll be eternally grateful that you stuck around to have this feeling. Don't give up.

I really hope you seek the help you need. It won't get better unless you do this. Best wishes",,0.0,,2012-10-03 21:54:48,,,0,False,,,,0,,c6h6ta5,,,,,t3_10w2vc,,,t1_c6h6ta5,,,,t3_10w2vc,,,,,,,,1430056380.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

Context is important. I will tell you my story, because telling it here makes it real. It means I'm admitting it's happened. It means I've stopped lying to myself. 

I was in a relationship with a woman for nearly 3 years. I loved her very much. We spoke of marriage on several occasions and had finally agreed not to get married until some years down the road. Personally, I would have married her this year or next, but love makes us patient, and patient I was willing to be. 

We got along famously, you see. Hardly ever had any fights. Disagreements we had for sure, but we always come to a resolution like mature people. Sex was fantastic 60% of the time, meh 30% of the time, and terrible the rest of that time. She could be closed up sometimes with her desires. I thought we were ""working through it"". (This was a clue I had not noticed).

Come winter last year, we agreed we would move into an apartment together somewhere nearby the two cities we lived in (merely 15 miles or so distant). Here or there, it mattered not, we were going to prepare.

Things were slowing down a lot at my job. Restrictions were imposed, some understandable (equipment and raise freezes) to bizzarre and tyrannical (forced to take vacation time even if employees had non left). This caused me considerable stress and worry. Non-essential personnel were bought out of their jobs or plain ""let go"". I was worried the business would shut down. The administration was tight lipped about that sort of information.

I sent out resumes, got an interview, and was offered a night-shift job after the Christmas holiday. It payed more, the healthcare was comparable and cheaper. I'd have to start over seniority wise and vacation wise, but it was an investment I was more than willing to make. I thought over the offer and discussed it with my partner. She didn't seem to have an opinion on it. (This was a clue I failed to notice). 

I decided to take the job. I didn't want to bet on a lame horse. 
I put in my two weeks notice in the middle of the week. I texted my partner and told her of the deed. I asked if she wanted to BBQ some ribs with me to celebrate me making a career move. She texted me back and just said, “Call me when you get off work.” (This was a clue I failed to notice.) That same day, I was escorted to one of the conference rooms, given the option of an exit interview (I declined the interview because I was furious and I am a conflict avoider by nature). I was then escorted out of the building and told to have a nice life. On the bright side, the HR lady was very nice about it all and teared up, gave me a hug (She really liked me). That made me feel better. But it couldn't shake the sense of foreboding doom that had settled in the pit of my stomach.

I could handle 2 weeks of not working. The time off would be nice. I called her on my way home but she didn't answer. I called her again when I got home. 

She told me she wanted to take a break. I asked her why, and she said she didn't want to talk about it yet, that she had to get her thoughts straight in her head. She asked if I just wanted to end it that night (Another clue I did not notice), and I told her I was willing to wait for her to be sure about her decision. I was in shock. I couldn't process the gravity of the event. It just sort of happened, I opted to respect her request. She said goodbye. I said goodbye. I sat down on my bed and stared at the carpet for hours. 
Four or five days later (I can't remember) she called me back. “We're in different places in life, I think we should move on.”

“I respect your decision.”

“Do you want to come over and talk about it?”

Why would I want to come over and talk about it? She had just murdered me. I was paralyzed. I didn't want to talk to her about it. I was furious with myself. All the clues came rushing to me. I had failed. I had failed to notice her behavior. That she had been thinking this over for months and months. That the reason her affection was cooling down consistently was not because of mere familiarity, but because she was losing interest in me. 

We said goodbye. My brother's birthday was that week. I lost myself in drink and weed, I put my whole soul into making my brother happy as a lark that day because I could not be happy myself. My own birthday was the next week. Again, drink and weed. Friends of hers came by to wish me well and tell me about how much of a bitch she was for leaving me high and dry. I defended her and chased them away. That was silly, but it seemed like the right thing to do. She didn't deserve any of that kind of talk, she made a choice to not be with someone she didn't want to be with anymore and that's all.

Months later I sent her an email asking her to explain why she thought we were in different places in life. She confessed that what she had said was a lie. The simple truth was, “I don't love you anymore, and I didn't want to lead you on, because I know how much you love me.”

I thought I had felt like a dead man before, but now I knew truly what it was to be a dead man walking. 

The rest of the year has been a blur of drinking, shutting myself in, and playing video games. I stopped doing some projects I had been involved in previously. I faded out of social circles. I found out who my real friends were: My brother, John Jameson, and Mary Jane. Everyone else I thought I knew jumped ship like rats. Oh sure, I got the cordial “Sorry about your luck” comments and discussions. But no one really took me aside. No trips to the pub for a round on me, your ol' buddy. No texts or phone calls or emails or facebook messages. Everyone vaporized.

I have no confidant anymore. I used to talk to her about my troubles. She is a wise person, and I always valued her advice. I can't talk to anyone else. I won't talk to my brother because he struggles with depression too (for different reasons. We had a shitty childhood and he turned to pills for a couple years. He's not doing pills anymore.) and I want to be strong for him. I need to seem like I'm shrugging it off and chugging along. Big brother is tall and strong and cheery. He can laugh at losing the love of his life, at his car breaking down constantly and being put in financial ruin, because he's strong like that. 

So here I am. I've confided in strangers on the internet because I couldn't keep it bottled in anymore. Now I've told someone, somehow. It's not a solution, but it's a bit of salve for the still fresh wounds. 

TL;DR

Love of my life left me. Friends jumped ship. Financial trouble. I'm depressed as shit. Drinking and smoking. ",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,I have been very depressed for 10 months.

206812,,True,Zeigzalar,,,,"Alaska was really cool.  I was pretty young since that's where I started school, but I remember that the sun was ALWAYS up during the summer (I had to put newspapers over my windows because it'd look like morning when it was midnight), and it was always night during the winter(which made for fun school days).  We had moose hanging out in our backyard all the time.

Lol I went with computers since it's the only other thing I could think of that I like/am really good with.  My family sees me as the computer fixer: whenever someone's having issues, they come to me.  So I knew right off the bat that I wouldn't have too much trouble getting into computer in college.

Back in high school, I had the same person that I have now.  Her and I have been best friends for over 6 years now XD  It's really nice talking to her, but I always worry that she'll get tired if I came to her too much.  As you can see, I can chat people's ear off if given the opportunity.

She's literally the only person I talk to on a daily basis.  She's also one of the few I can engage in a worthwhile conversation with.  Most of my other friends only like small-talk.  But I feel as if I make any mistake, I'd be screwed.  She's much more forgiving of me than I am of myself, so my worrying is irrational.  If only I could just stop XD

My parents getting involved was for the better, and looking back, it was good that I told them.  I was more immature then than I am now, so having my parents as a ""leash"" did help (even if I wouldn't have admitted it back then).  I only saw the psychiatrist once because I convinced him I was fine.  I don't even remember what I did to get out of that, but it worked haha.

Not even close to an only child; oldest of four.  I find fun in being the oldest all the time lol.  How about you?

My depression went away back then when a few close friends that I had made at the time gave me suggestions as to what goals I should set, and then I made some friends with underclassmen when I became a junior.  I became a leader in our band and got more involved in school activities.

I should be doing the same goal setting now, but it's been different.  I haven't done any college activities because I knew I was going to transfer to a different school.  I don't know what to expect now that I'm going to be living on my own.  I think my depression will be cured when I join a club or two when I go to the new university.  Now would probably be a good time for me to look up what clubs there are, and regaining my hobbies XD

Lol I wish I could stop thinking sometimes, but I have no control at all.  I hear meditation is effective, (doesn't really sound like it would be), but I'll give that a try.  You sound like me with the walls haha.  I feel like I put so much work into putting em all up in the right places, that tearing them down would be ruining my effort XD They get in the way sometimes, but they do good too, or else I would've never built em in the first place.

When I look through this, I feel like a lot of my problems would be solved if I wrote down and kept track of everything.  Then I could turn my crazy goals into mini, realistic goals; and I would have an easier time keeping track of my schedule (I can get really disorganized; forgetting homework, etc).  Then it piles up and I get mad at myself for procrastinating.  It was pretty easy keeping everything organized in my head back in grade school, but now that I'm in college and out in the real world, using my memory won't cut it.  I suggest you do that too, if you don't do it already lol.  Days get really hectic and I'd have more time to relax if I just wrote what I needed to do down each morning XD

Do you know what caused your depression?  Was it like one problem at first, that kept on becoming other problems you can't manage?  I can't imagine being depressed from 8th grade all the way to now :/  I was the one who came initially for help, but it feels unbalanced if I'm doing all the venting.  You don't have to talk if you don't want to, but you're welcome to if you'd like.

I'm a 19 year old freshman in college, and I believe I've been dealing with depression for the past year or two, give or take. My motivation and focus stay at zero most days, and my grades are barely passing as a result. All I can think about is how badly I'm fucking things up and how I'm letting my parents down. I haven't made many good friends since I moved away for college and spend most of my time alone, mulling over stupid things I've said, or the fact that I'm going nowhere. At the risk of sounding like some pseudo-intellectual idiot, I truly believe life is meaningless, and in accordance with this belief, don't find any point in setting goals for myself. I basically take up space. That's about it. I would never commit suicide, because I wouldn't want to hurt my family, but I'm hardly enthusiastic about living. I'm aware at this point that I'm probably depressed, and that the best thing to do would be to speak to a therapist or get on meds, but  I can't bring myself to tell people how I feel. In fact, I've visited a therapist once before, on my parents suggestion, and ended up just lying my ass off and telling her what I knew would convince her I was mentally well. I'm terrified of letting people know what's going on. So anyway, I'm not sure what my purpose was in writing this, but thanks for reading, if you did. Just wanted to get that off my chest I guess.

It probably gives you the feeling that you can't rely on your parents for help? And yet they're still there physically, must be incredibly difficult.

First off it's not your ""responsibility"" to learn their language, it should have been their responsibility as parents to learn you their language/learn the local language, but I guess you could try to motivate them to learn the local language better? Try telling them that you would really like to be able to talk to them (If that's even possible through sign language).

97670,,True,[deleted],,,,"I definitely agree with what you wrote in the first paragraph. Reddit is a huge community and despite being online-based has done some tremendous things in real life. I think meetups and relationships are forged on a frequent basis. Perhaps posting on r/England or somewhere will garner more attention if you really want to ""not be a loner anymore"", which is something I don't understand but you clearly want to do.

Not knowing what you want to do at your age is fine. Like helpwithlove, I'm 23 and that's still pretty young. But you control your own fate. Shape your reality to fit towards your idealities. You think that your pre-uni days were the ""best of your life""? I may not have much experience, and I certainly don't know England, but holy shit you are going to be amazed at how much more freedom and opportunities you will have at university. I've never had a girlfriend, and I don't have many--if a single girl--to call a friend either. I don't really give a shit about what people are doing on Facebook, either. I have a vision of my life, and I'm shaping my reality to fit that ideal future. Every day, every night. And if that makes me socially awkward, I don't give a shit. That's the price I'll pay. 

I've never been to a party and I have no interest in going. I listen to death metal and heavier things so nothing to talk with those people that blast house music and rap tracks. I don't play beer pong, and I like drinking by myself in a room, perhaps with one or two other people, not a huge-ass crowd. You seem to idealize parties as the ultimate social gathering...I've had better interactions at a 10-minute ping-pong match where my ass was handed to me the first time I played than talking with some people who routinely go to parties. 

I have no idea about the current events going on in England. If you really want to be social, find a few, and do light research on them. Politics, video games, environment, whatever.

I'll try to be brief but I know that can sometimes not be the case with me..

So, I've been with depression officially since last year. Lots of ups and downs and going through everything from extreme anxiety, days long depressive crying sessions, to self-harm. I've learned a bit on how to cope with it. I find solitude in talking to certain people, my music, and I've also quit drinking/drugs entirely. I try to embrace what it is as it does in a way, define me for better or for worse. 

But lately I've been feeling in conflict with inclusion. I suppose I consider myself to be an open minded and friendly person. I rarely get angry or berate people and I maintain (I feel like at least..) good relationships with most. Despite all this, I don't feel included in a lot of things including my friends group from back home, my school program, my musician circles, my every day life. Especially since I've given up drinking, I realize how fucking awkward I am in social situations. I realize more now that I slur my words and fuck up simple sentences in writing/talking. I feel like I'm seen as some sort of over sensitive asshole because I support things that a lot of people couple into the activities of ""social justice warriors"" even though I am very patient with how I view people. I never assume that, because someone uses a word I don't think should be used or believes in something slightly different to mine, they're a bigoted piece of shit. I recognize that there are some legitimately hateful people and I avoid those types at all costs but I think the majority out there are well intentioned but following a different path than I am. I feel that on top of all this, I've become a black sheep to my friends group for believing in what I believe and being into music/activities that aren't the same as theirs. 

In all honesty I'm not outspoken about my beliefs. I talk about it, have discussions, post articles on my fbook, etc but rarely do I feel like I'm crossing a line and if I do, I think I'm quick to recognize it. I feel that because a couple friends have recently told me things like:

""You push things too far with your words and you give radicals a bad name.""
""Can you not see the irony of what you're saying in your silly little brain?""
""You're so political now...""

So while I try not to think any less of myself for merely discussing a topic in my most honest way possible, I feel like there's people from my small town whom have thought very different about me because I no longer do the things they do which is drink every weekend and do whatever. I've had a lot of people from there delete me off facebook yet have kept a majority of my contacts list and I can't help but feel like this is a reflection on myself. 

Beyond this issue, I feel excluded from certain musical circles because I don't think I'm good enough. I think I'm sub par. Someone who might be a jack of all trades but a master of none and doomed to invisible supporting roles. I feel like even people in those circles who also deal with depression, would rather not listen to me talk when I'm sad because I can get to be far too negative. I try really hard to force myself to be happy and I seem like it on the outside but inside I'm a horrible mess and I'm only proud that I haven't hurt myself in awhile.

I'm told not to but I just can't help but feel guilty. I'm horrified at the thought of being thought of as a shit friend. I'm horrified of being lonely. I'm horrified of being the topic of irritation to a certain group of people. When I think about these things, coupled with my depressive elements, it absolutely destroys me and it's to the point where I feel very angry and on the verge of losing it on someone. I've never been a violent or aggressive person so all those emotions have long been suppressed. I want to learn how to better cope with these emotions as I don't feel like compromising my beliefs or my life choices to satisfy people.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,Feeling like the world is against me...,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/20anzj/feeling_like_the_world_is_against_me/,

I am holding my thoughts back even when I am hating myself for not saying that I love her. She says nothing will change and that is what I fear the most. That nothing will happen. That she won't say she loves me the same. That I am forever doomed to be tormented by her future boyfriends that she will talk about. I am becoming a ""brightside"" (Someone who is jealous of another person who is with the person they want). I know it's not bad to be jealous but I get attached easily and I hate that. I shouldn't let that kind of stuff get to me but I allow it for any emotion I can feel whether that be sadness or self hatred, it's something I can feel. Never happiness.

I like helping others with their problems but don't like talking about my own. I don't know why.

When I was ten I started having suicidal thoughts but even before that I remember that there where days when I couldn't get out of bed.

I started therapy when I was 15. With my first therapist we talked a lot about things from the past, and while things that happened to me in the past has obviously affected me they aren't really that big of a deal and I can talk about them forever without that changing how I feel now.

With my second therapist (who I'm seeing now) we deal with what happens NOW, how I feel, how I think and so on. The thing is that I've been seeing her for more than 2 years now and there is absolutely no progress.

A few months ago I started taking zoloft, hoping that would help. The only thing that has changed is my sleeping - I used to sleep for 12+ hours every night and often fell asleep during the day because I was so tired. Now I have some difficulties falling asleep and I wake up early because of HORRIBLE nightmares. In the end I'm still not as tired during the days so that's an improvement, but the dreams are really unsetteling and makes me dread falling asleep every night.

I usually don't ask for advice on the internet but I'm really lost right now and don't know what to do. Should I keep seeing my therapist and hope that it will help some day or should I start seeing someone else? Should I keep taking my medication, or maybe try a different kind?

Basically every facet of my life is complete shit. 

So I'm a 20 year old male, about to turn 21. I failed out of a community college over a year ago and I still haven't even told anyone. I faked going to class for over a year and I even told my parents that I applied to colleges. My parents think I'm currently waiting to hear back. And I made up a lie to my friends that I was accepted to college. Why did I do all of this? I don't even know. It just snowballed. One lie led into the next and I was in so deep I could never tell the truth. At some point the truth is gonna come out and I have no fucking idea what I'm going to do. I think about this shit 24/7.

And that might not even be my biggest problem. A couple of years ago I developed this anxiety disorder called paruresis. It's basically extreme shy bladder if you've ever heard of that. I can't take a piss when people are too close by. I know it may sound ridiculous to you, but it's a real problem. So I can't really use public restrooms, often times I can't use restrooms in friend's houses, I even sometimes can't use my home bathroom because they are really close to rooms that usually have people in them. This has basically fucked up everything in my life. I can't really have a job because I can't go to the fucking bathroom. Most social situations get fucked up because of this. It just ruins everything. And on top of that, you have people who judge you for not having a job and living at home. What the fuck is this? I would do anything for a normal 20 year old's life. My friends all go to school, have girlfriends, go to parties, most of them are having the time of their fucking lives. And then I'm sitting here on my computer all day not doing shit. Oh and not just that, they all have internships and are doing really well in college.

I have numerous other problems. Bad social anxiety, horrible self image, a fucked up sleep schedule. Surprisingly I don't have a drug problem, so I guess that's a positive. And right now all I really want to do is play some CS:GO and I can't even because my Internet is shit. How the fuck has everything gone this wrong?

I've been out since the beginning of the summer again. I always have a moderate level of depression/anxiety, but it usually doesn't keep me from being too functional, I'm just sad a lot. But over the past three weeks or so, it's flared up again and I haven't been able to do anything. 

So I'm considering going back into therapy again. But I have several roadblocks that are stopping me from doing it. First, I really don't feel like therapy has helped me that much in the past, which explains why I keep going in and out of it. I'll get back and enter therapy, and then end up leaving (after several months to a couple years, usually) because I just don't think it's helping me. 

Now, of course, I recognize that part of that problem could be that I'm not that dedicated to my own recovery. But the thing is that that's still a problem--I really just don't want to invest the energy that I know I'll need to to get better (yes, I know that's sick and wrong). So I hate the idea of wasting a therapist's time again. But I just really need to get back on top of my schoolwork so I need to shake off this funk.

If it hasn't happened yet you will most likely be visited by someone asking if it was a suicide attempt, questions about your medicine, etc. Answer honestly, this person isn't going to accuse you of anything, and will have some good suggestions of where to go from here.

An inpatient treatment center will also likely be brought up. Because you are a minor your parents will have full say over what happens with that. Talk to your parents, be honest with them. I went to an inpatient facility straight from the hospital(it was also my second attempt so it might be different for you, but I was asked the same questions the first time. I lied and ended up in the same spot a few months later.) 

It wasn't as terrifying as it sounded and actually worked well for me. If you feel you don't need inpatient treatment, tell your parents you think an outpatient program would be better for you. The hospital will probably have names and numbers of facilities to give you. I absolutely loved the place I went for outpatient treatment. 

Also if you haven't been given charcoal your liver is probably ok. Which is really good. Also good they let you have your phone (I'm guessing that's how you're posting?) mine was taken from me and given to my mom.

7594,,True,thevirtualme,,,,"University is a very strange time. You are given so much freedom and none of the means to do anything with it. Drinking, smoking and sleeping in are the absolute student culture. It is an unhealthy lifestyle and a difficult situation to avoid. I personally hated university and I think it was a real waste of my time. 


If this isn't the case for you and you *need* a degree to progress (perhaps you're looking at medicine, engineering etc.) then my advice is just to carry on, try to keep regular hours, try to smoke and drink in the evenings - but stop beating yourself up for failing to do that 100% of the time.


For me - this exact lifestyle changed when I started work. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't too hard either because for once; I had to. It wasn't about willpower it was simple necessity. Don't worry about the lifestyle you have now. You are young, perhaps you have wasted some time, but you have plenty of it left. Also wasting one's time is often one of the most enjoyable uses of it I've found! 


The key is not to hate yourself for sleeping late, smoking one more, having one more glass. Forgive yourself, if you don't feel like getting up then let yourself sleep and don't hate yourself for it. Try to do an hour of work, then two, try to go outside for a walk, jog, cycle whatever. It doesn't have to all happen right this very second, it doesn't *have* to happen at all. But you know you can do these things - don't hate yourself for not doing them, like yourself for being able to do them, there's plenty of people who can't.

And you respond like normal, “Good, yourself?”

Inside you feel like something is missing, a hole, or some dreary feeling

But you keep saying the same so no one worries or asks you anymore questions

_

You tell your family

At first they try to convince you otherwise,  you should be happy with everything

But you know you aren’t

Later, they realize it more, and they worry

But again, you stop talking about it because you don’t want them to worry

They think all is well again

_

You tell friends

Most are supportive, some are shocked

You stop because of the mixed reactions

People tend to like you more if you fake emotion

They care, but it’s tough to talk to them, how do you start

After a while, they look like they get tired of hearing it for so long

And yet, you still feel it, they only hear of it, so you stop, so they can feel better

_

Work is work

Go in daily, same greeting, no matter how you feel

Keep smiling and looking non depressed

Want the day to finish as fast as possible

Then when work ends, you go home

_

Home where the place is empty

No one there of course, except the cat

She needs attention and love, so you give her everything

Maybe one of the last things that keeps you going

Even then, it’s still quiet, and you still feel alone

_

Try anything to make you forget

Or anything to make the feeling go away

It’s temporary of course, you know that

But it’s better than nothing

If people found out, they would never expect it, and they would blame everything on that

And yet, it’s the only thing that keeps you going on some days

_

Try to get sleep

But you can’t, the mind is always awake, thinking

How things went, how it could be better, why you are still living

And when you wake, you still wonder why am I here

_

You try new things

And yet they feel like you are forcing them

And that doesn’t even work

It’s not who you are

_

You count the days, months, years

Still counting

Not sure if counting up or down anymore

Just counting

Forget where you started and don't know where it ends

_

You see things that are funny

You laugh, emotions are still there, just not like they were

But you still feel the hole

You could change emotions from laughing to blank face within a second

_

It feels dark everywhere

You yell and no one responds

Just echos

You see a faint light

But any direction you go, it seems to keep fading

So you stay still, hoping it comes to you

_

Take meds to help

They make everything dull, gray. 

There is no light anymore

You can see everything for how it is with night vision

Doesn’t help, just makes you feel nothing

_

Stop meds and the light appears again in the darkness

But it never gets brighter, only more faded

You close your eyes to remember the light

But even that starts to fade

_

You give and give, never asking for anything yourself

And yet when you do want help, you feel like you're asking for too much

So you just do more for others

Make them feel better, so they don’t feel like you do

_

Meet people they say

You try, online, or going out

Just no luck, you might find someone interesting, but they never seem like a good candidate

Just maybe a friend, but you don’t even try anymore, why bother

_

See others happy, content, doing well

Compare yourself, you shouldn’t, but you don’t know who you are

Try to tell yourself that will be you

But when you try, it feels fake

_

Just waiting

For an opportunity

Or a new start

Try new things, expand

They give you new outlooks

But you are still in the same place

_

You want to break free

But the chains are mixed up

It’s easier to leave them

_

Get older

Still here

Still lonely

Light only flashes every once in a while

Sometimes not for weeks


_

Go searching for light

But feel more lost

But you keep trying

_

Finally find light

But it’s broken

You don’t know how to fix it

You hope someone who can will come along

But light is no longer needed, no one will come to fix it

They think it’s working

_

Find out it’s your switch that’s broken

No one else has a problem

Just you

Was never working in the first place

Created light in your mind

But can’t anymore

_

Build own light

Never turns out how you thought it would

So you scrap and retry

But it seems impossible

And that alone sucks, whether you are clinically depressed or not.

I personally find it very healthy, though, that you are reaching out to someone: it means that you can look inside yourself, analyze things that occur to your mood and are not scared or embarrassed to put them in front of others (even if virtual others). My personal advice is to try and see if there is someone around you who you can talk to about your situation (and if you want to put a little effort in it, try and find a person that you think could understand you).

Could it be that you are also kind of reevaluating your interests? Do you like your college, the people around you, the things you are studying? You can't do well in college if you don't have enough motivation (wherever it comes from) to stay on your books!

* He's help me overcome anorexia and self-harm so I understand what it feels like to be hurt. 

He's been to a psychiatrist and does get meds and he also goes to a therapist. However, I feel like it doesn't help a lot. He gets waves of relatively calm feelings and then very bad, suicidal thoughts. Prior to feeling very depressed, he also gets very angry. We are both still in school and I think that might be a big reason why he gets upset so easily. In our school and environment,  caring is not a very important thing, and because there is no one, he says he only has me (which is fine, just that it is sometimes hard for me mentally). I've tried helping him and all the solutions we have came up with either help for a short period of time, or they don't help at all. 

He gets upset really easily and threatened to self-harm and kill himself more than once. He tells me to leave because he knows he is a bad influence.

Sure, people knew I was ""generally unhappy"", but nobody *knew*.  At least I didn't think so.

Last year, my freshman year of college,  I got really close with a friend, 'B'.  We're still good friends, but don't live with each other anymore (he's an RA now).  We're both really busy, but we try to hang out from time to time.  I spent all of Saturday in my room watching Sportscenter recovering from a heavy Friday night of drinking and rolling, I didn't even make the effort to eat anything.  B calls me to see if I was at my place, I said yes and he showed up with a liter of Bourbon ten minutes later (at around 8PM Saturday night).  We split half the bottle before getting on the bus and left to an apartment to see dormmates from last year.  Us two polished off the bottle and had a bit of vodka at the party.  Needless to say we were both very drunk.

I got really upset at one point while we left the party to smoke blacks and my bong on the back porch.  We don't remember why it started, but we both knew I was upset (we had dinner on Sunday to try and piece together what happened).  While in our overly-drunk and my depressed state, it got to the topic of me being depressed in general, and he asked me if I remembered when I told him I wanted to kill myself.  I said no, I didn't remember this--I don't.  Last year we got on top of the roof of a house (one story, very short drop to the ground from the front, still idiotic in hindsight as we were both blackout drunk) and spent an hour looking at the country stars listening to music and smoking blacks.  Apparently I was really depressed that night and told him that I wanted to (thoughts that were, at the time, true to some accord).  I don't want to kill myself, but I have no desire to be in existence.

When he asked me if I remembered this on Saturday night, I lost it.  B told me he'd be really upset if I anything happened to me, I was bawling at this point.  I've spent the past few years able to bottle up my emotions trying to not make any ""deep"" connections with people because I didn't want to ever emotionally hurt them in the future.  Knowing at least one person cares is the greatest but worst feeling at the same time.  I know my parents and family care for me, but I don't feel it.  I've never felt it.

I've been a train wreck for the past two days and I don't know what to do.  It's like every ounce of sadness I've bottled up the past five years of my life has come out the past two days, I'm so lost.

I'm just so compelled to tell someone, and I don't want it to be anyone I know, so here I am.

I'm depressed.
Whenever I'm alone, which is often, I speak out loud against myself. I say that I hate myself, which is mostly true, and I say other things but I'm not sure how the rules of this sub reddit work, so let's leave that where it is for now.

Anyways, I have this thing against telling anyone that I'm depressed, or hurt or troubled. I've boiled it down to three main reasons as to why I don't. The first is dependency; I don't want any relationship of mine revolving around the fact that I'm depressed. That is to say, I don't want to have one of my current friends turn into someone who feels as though they have to worry about me, and that affect how they treat me. Ultimately I think that's silly, because no one thinks about me enough for that to be any sort of substantial argument, but it contributes.

The second reason is that I'm embarrassed. Explaining why I'm depressed to someone would mean discussing aspects of myself that I find absolutely shameful. Not the sort of thing you need to ask forgiveness for, but the sort of thing you would judge someone  for. Or at least *I* would judge someone for...

Lastly, it's because I don't deserve to be depressed. And I'm aware how poorly that is phrased, but that's the way I think. My life is fine. My past was great. My future could be amazing if not for the fact that I would be in it, yet I'm depressed. I fear that maybe it's just in my head, too. That I want to tell someone just so they'll pity me and validate that my life is unusually difficult, so it's okay that I've amounted to nothing as of yet. My life ISN'T unusually difficult. I'm super lucky, even. Depression is a serious thing, and nothing serious has ever happened to me.
*Edit: I've tried rewording this reason a couple times, but it never describes properly just what I want to say. That frustrates me beyond belief.

I don't know.
I want to be anything so bad, but I stop myself from doing it. There's a residing doubt orbiting around my head, and sometimes it's behind me and I can see nothing but the beautiful sun, but then there's the eclipse, and it's so hard to see what I'm doing, or why.

The body adjusts to whatever state it is in, and if you haven't been getting much exercise, it can be damaging to the body to like, kick in full force with something very vigorous.  I have found that even if I feel good in the moment, sometimes I end up feeling sore and/or exhausted and that makes it even easier to slip back into depression after the exercise high wears off.

Also, sometimes people can have thoughts or emotional associations with things related to exercise, that can trigger their depression.  For example, I had a period of time in which I had an ankle injury that made walking uncomfortable, and I also was very depressed during that time.  During that time, any sort of physical exercise that involved my ankle was immensely frustrating to me...I would go on a brief walk and I'd often end up feeling really angry, frustrated, and hopeless, in response to the pain I was experiencing.

In my case, getting out of that situation required going to a physical therapist, who helped me to understand what was going on with my ankle and my body, and gave me a different sort of exercise that helped me to fix the problem with my ankle.  When I addressed this problem, I then began going on walks, and dancing again, and those activities began to bring me joy again.

Another really basic but important example, telling someone to just go on a walk or a run when it's bitter cold outside and they don't have warm clothes is missing a big point.

These situations highlight why I think it's important to like, look at each person, their body, their level of activity, and not advocate for some one-size-fits-all solution.  Sometimes just telling them ""get exercise"" may be ignoring one of the major blocks to whatever they are dealing with.  Their problem may be a practical constraint (like the weather example), or maybe some physical problem they haven't diagnosed yet (as in my case), and solving it may require something other than psychological advice.",,0.0,,2014-03-22 19:51:31,,,0,False,,,,0,,cg98l2c,,,,,t3_212wfq,,,t1_cg98l2c,,,,t1_cg989tc,,,,,,,,1433022177.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

My life has been one big downward spiral. 
Crippling social anxiety and depression has left me completely alone. While I sometimes prefer things that way, life does get unbearably lonely.
I have lost so many friends over the years, but managed to keep one. Sadly it's a guy I met online way back in '06. We would talk every day, he would disappear for months when he had a proper normal girlfriend, then we'd go right back to talking when his relationships failed. You could say I'm like his support system, when his life goes pear-shaped I am there 24/7 till things go back to peachy. 

We've planned on meeting hundreds of times, but I can never bring myself to follow through with our plans.  This guy is social, and extroverted. He has hundreds of female friends who look like models, and I just pale in comparison. Pictures he sends me of them gnaws on my confidence like nothing else, and honestly adds to my already awful depression.

When I try to talk to him less, or ask that we cut contact completely, he refuses. He'd guilt me into staying by telling me he loves me and how he could never see himself living without me in his life.

Now I haven't seen this girl the entire week until today so everyday this week I'd try to dress/look my best just in case she saw me. Like I stated before I didn't get to see her until today. Today (like every week) my school had a football game that everyone goes to including me and the girl. 

BACKSTORY: I'm friends with her ex-boyfriend. 

I was talking to him as she approached us with her friends everything seemed a bit awkward. But we did what we usually did I met up with her and I followed her like a puppy. I was expecting her ex to just branch off with some other people but he followed too, I felt a little bit strange and annoyed. All was well though they talked/flirted I didn't think it would damage my chances that much, but I was wrong. By the end of the game they were holding hands prancing around. I'm going to be honest I was jealous as hell. 

Currently I'm cursing at the wind punching a pillow. I think sometimes I get to attached to people/things being in my life that is why when my dad passed I could barely do a thing. 

To make things even worse I'm going to her birthday party tomorrow and I'm assuming her ex well maybe not ex anymore will be there. I can't explain to you what I'm feeling. It's a mixture of ""jealousness"", anger, and a loss of hope. (If that makes any sense.) But seriously guys what should I do to overcome this and get my mind off of it, it's all I'm thinking of.

I'm a 23 year old guy, and I thought I'd share a bit about my own journey with depression.  I'm really interested to hear whether others have noticed some of the same things I have.

I first suspected something was up with my brain chemistry sometime around freshman year of high school, but it didn't really develop into fully-formed depression until I was about 18.  I had a really awful, depressed spring during my freshman year of college, then got professional help for the first time the following summer.  Although in absolute terms I think my depression has gotten slightly worse since my initial diagnosis, my ability to manage it has improved greatly.

In my case, feeling ""down"" is intermittent and closely linked to feelings of anxiety.  The exact duration of the feeling varies from a few hours to as long as 3-4 weeks, with the average being around a week.  In most cases, I can feel that it's going to come on a few days before I really start feeling down.  A typical episode increases in severity until it plateaus for a few days (variable), then I wake up one day and feel considerably better.  Often there is a slight ""rebound"" during which I actually feel really, really good for a few hours or sometimes a whole day.  It's a kind of general euphoria about everything.  Then I kind of level out and feel normal for a while until another episode hits.
 
Some things I've noticed make it better:

* A low-dose anti-anxiety med taken in the few days before I actually start feeling down seems to reduce the duration and intensity of the episode.
* Having something to focus on during an episode.
* Physical contact.
* Running.
* Cognitive-behavioral approaches- recognizing negative though processes and trying to avoid them (esp. in the days preceding an episode).
* Food.

Some things that make it worse:

* Winter.  I always feel the worst during January, February, and March.  These are the only times I've ever had a down period that reached over a month.  I just came out of one that lasted 3 weeks or so.
* Dealing with strangers, crowds, or unfamiliar social situations during an episode.
* Having to make major decisions or argue with someone.
* Dealing with my parents in any capacity.  I live on my own so I don't see them that often, but even a short phone call can really leave me down in the dumps.

One thing I've found is that social contact is kind of a wildcard.  If I'm feeling really down, sometimes I spend time around others and I feel much, much worse.  This happens maybe 40% of the time.  But sometimes spending time with friends can make me feel much better.  There's no predicting it, either; sometimes I am really dreading spending time with people, but then I end up really enjoying it.

In terms of tangible effects on my life, the biggest effect depression has had has been on my ability to form relationships.  Often I will be friendly and engaged on my ups, but then I'll meet them later during a down and be cold and distant without meaning to.  

What are some of your thoughts about this?  Anyone else noticed similar ups and downs?  Does the feeling vary in intensity?

These animals are not an investment, they are in need of loving, long term homes. I would never get rid of a cat just because she was no longer able to benefit me. It seems kind of callous and cruel to me, I'll never understand. 

AWWW! Penny looks very cheeky. Loving those tummy spots!

My partner got me a bengal, I never personally would have picked a bengal myself back then. They are gorgeous and I love having them now but not something I've ever looked into previous to being surprised with Lily. I picked Lily (I met them the day we were purchasing her) over her sister due to her rosettes though (I know, horrible reason). I think they're gorgeous looking creatures and that makes them very desired. I do like how they behave more like dogs (playing fetch, playing in water)  and that definitely makes them amazing pets.

Then we got Orchid, with the reason for that being Lily would need a friend (She's co-dependant, unusual I know. It's due to her breeder not treating her right, thanks incompetent selfish show breeder) well Lily and Orchid, they didn't get along (and are complete opposites in terms of personality). 
So when we decided to start our own cattery (With mummy Orchid being the first in our line to breed), we naturally decided to keep one of the babies around lily from being young to ensure she got her friend/partner in food stealing crime. 

Then Orchid had Midna and Saria, Saria being the ""chosen one"" to keep. She's been around Lily her entire Life and they truly love each other so that worked out well!

... and now we have four. Midna was meant to be rehomed but it's harder to let her go. She's a part of the family now and I get super hurt over possibly rehoming her. As a result, we've been super picky about where she will go, rejecting a lot of potential owners when there's a red flag. 

And that is how we ended up with four bengals LOL!

The guilt you feel is just a warped sense of what happened. Hindsight is 20/20, as they say. But on a less clichéd note, anything that happens to him (that he does to himself) is of his own making, you cannot be held responsible. You already said that you don't know him in real life, just an online persona. I understand that he might be more than that to you, he is your friend, and it will hurt for a long time and I am not trying to belittle what you are feeling, I just want to give you another set of eyes, someone viewing from the outside. I hope this all makes sense. 

If nothing else, try to see that if you truly understand how even the thought of taking your life might make your loved ones feel, it can be a source of strength and recovery, if you choose to see it as such. 

I joined a chat room 9+ years ago (depression/anxiety) and I was 16 at the time. Worst mistake I've made, I think. Filled with people craving attention, making up stuff, using it as a dating service. I was young and impressionable and it was an awful drain on my emotions and mind. 

But, I met about a dozen people who I stayed in contact with, and they are amazing people, I don't really talk about my head-crap-stuff with anyone but my partner, but my real point is, if you hang out with people and ""stew"" in your depression, it will stay around for as long as you let it. I'm not saying you can just act happy and that will make you happy, I know it's not that easy. 

You can make friends and hang out with them and not let them know about your issues (unless they are immediately obvious like Tourette's for example) but if you put the effort in, you can definitely get to the point where you aren't defined by your depression or anxiety or whatever the issues are that you are coping with. 

If nothing else, it may help to get your feelings out on paper, notepad, start a private (or public) blog, whatever. Don't let it all sit up in your head. Whatever you decide I hope that you hear good news soon.

I've been struggling a lot with depression lately, &amp; some self-harm.

Yesterday I found out someone very close to me that is my ex has been manipulating me acting as if she was still interested in me, I suspected things for months &amp; tried bringing it up but she dismissed it and yesterday I found out it was true.

what I want with this post is just some support, I feel really devestated, &amp; I've had problems breathing properly ever since. Trying constantly to try and stay on a level where I don't feel anxious or see the world through a scope that only shows misery and worry. After I found out I had a very big panic attack resulting in me not being able to sleep until 6 am (my nights are already bad as it is) &amp; I woke up anxious aswell. It doesn't seem to go away for more than 5 minutes at a time.

This is not the first time this has happened, &amp; it hurts a lot, so much pain, I just tried eating but could barely eat 1/4 of my meal.

Has anyone been through something similar? This has strictly been an online relationship, which means there's a lot of room for deceiving. I've also been really honest, &amp; it hurts me that this is what I get in return.

Me:

age 1-8 lived happily with mom + dad , age 8.5 mom leaves dad because he is a genuine asshole , age 8.5 - 11.5 live in grandmothers house for many years under her strict rules and dictatorship but mom always there for me to make me feel happy and confident that we will make it through

age 11.5 - puberty make me a social outcast when I enter O levels, I used to come home to an empty house with nothing to do after doing my school work and ultimately got addicted to gaming but now it's under much control to where I game a couple of hours instead of 5 hours if not more 

puberty - 19: NEVER ever lets me go out with anyone because she doesn't trust the ""company"" i keep. Insisted that every friend I made had to go through a rigorous back ground check by her and she had to talk to ALL my friends parents, when I told my school friends this they called a psycho and made me a social outcast. The six years in that school were the worst years of my life to where everyday I wanted to hide in my closet and never come out or go and wished I died every day. 

and I might also add that this was her ""crazy mom"" period, she took every opportunity to humiliate me, ridicule me and make a mockery in front of every family we had be they distant, neighbor or even our own. She told all my dirty secrets like how I masturbate to porn ... WOW BIG SECRET , MEN MASTURBATE?! DID YOU KNOW FISH BREATHE UNDER WATER TOO? point being that is only one of 1000's of horrible things she has done to me since this age group and for that I have officially accepted that my mother died and some whore has taken her place. 

Age 16 - 22.5: Fall into depression, still pursues in making me the center of the punchline by telling everyone in the state / province / country that I am seeing a shrink because I am the one with the problem while SHE IS A FUCKING SAINT WHO HAS NEVER DONE A SINGLE FUCKING THING.

Age 19 - 22.5 gets conned by our family lawyer saying he can get me into a good university for 3 years I tell her that the bastard has conned us but she believes some asshole that comes out of no where and doesn't listen to a word I have to say. It was only recently where I took things into my own hands and got my admission and now am rubbing it in her face 

Just turned 23 and going to university just now with classmates no older than 21 at most, and I wish I can live at the university instead of having to come home to her as even a hello from her makes my blood boil to where I can't just look at her anymore without thinking horrible things. 

PLEASE Don't give me that ""She is your mother, she deserves not one but a 100 chances."" I HAVE GIVEN HER EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ""Friends"" OR ""BOND"" BUT EACH TIME I LET HER IN SHE ONLY USES THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN MY DOOR OF TRUST, GET DIRT ON ME AND HOLD IT OVER MY HEAD LIKE A TICKING TIME BOMB. Now I have NOTHING left to hide from anyone because I don't let her in at all and as soon as I see her I just get filled with hate. 

I will be fully honest and tell you that I don't have the resources, finance or the patience to raise money to move out of the house and unfortunately this bitch is well connected to some of the top families in my country, unless I leave this country and change my looks this bitch will make my life out of the house a living nightmare, before I used to wait for the weekends now I wish that they go as fast as possible so I can stall at the university as long as I can ... 

Is there ever a way for me to look past everything she has done? I can say this to her face and admit it in any court over any thing that she has done HORRIBLE things to me which make my worst enemies look like kittens. She is the sole reason I never trust women and am a closet sexist and hence have trust / faith issues in any and all women. 

I wish everyday and think every night that there must be a way to let her in but all the times in the past I look back at her betrayals only strengthen my resolve that she is beyond redemption and my forgiveness, I even told her to her face once that if I / You die first I want you to know that I will never forgive you for all the shit you have done to me in the past and I have made peace with that, I won't beg for forgiveness over your grave, I won't shed a tear when you die and I hope you leave this world sooner so I don't have to look at you anymore 

Before you rush in to call me a bad son let me be clear that I acknowledge everything she has done for me in the past but the monster she has become now is simply too much for me to take, I don't know who she is anymore and I know very well I am not attached to this female.

191043,,True,RustlerRun,,,,"Interestingly the deterministic mind set holds little empirical evidence. Although I am no expert my current course in Quantum Mechanics in college has reinforced the view that really the world is a cloud of probabilities, a collection of choices. There is no set path. Of course on the microscopic scale this seems cut and dry. But on the macroscopic scale, in every day life I understand how powerful the ruts of habit can be. How difficult it can be to see anything beyond the next imminent dissapointment. Often I get stuck in circular thought patterns, vortexes of negative emotion that feed on themselves.
Hwo to break the cycle? Im not sure. For me often it takes a single act. Even something very simple. A single moment where I feel I can decide. I can choose. I use moments like that to exercise what little free will I feel I have at the moment. It reminds me that not all of my life is set. That I have choices even if they are often difficult to see. I choose to talk to a stranger. To offer a smile. To ask a question. 

Maybe these are small, seemingly stupid things but for me they reconfirm that I do have a choice in some of my life. By NO means is depression a choice. But even within the locked down mentality that depression generates you can choose some things, maybe small things, but none the less small but important things that are under your control.",,0.0,,2014-01-15 22:04:49,,,0,False,,,,0,,ceqhiba,,,,,t3_1va212,,,t1_ceqhiba,,,,t3_1va212,,,,,,,,1431958300.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

Although understandable if one's childhood experiences potentially etched this desire into their mind (albeit I'm somewhat of the belief that all desires are innately malleable by at least some means) however, it still seems to be peculiar and especially annoying when one's own mind responds to subjective pressure from local peers (e.g. in a local community where one may not attain a status regardless of whether they consciously desire it or not).  It seems that these desires can even re-occur despite inactivity for an extended duration, which may suggest that their activity still lingers unconsciously on some level of mind.  

So my question is ultimately of whether there are any real justification of this mental activity beyond what seems to be a typical self-righteousness of an individual (e.g. individuals who seem to place a special emphasis on this focus, perhaps even suggesting that the contrary is somehow negative), and secondly of whether there are definitive ways to at least replacing these desires with more productive desires (i.e. I'm also of the believe that one can only have a limited amount of active desires such that some will consume more focus of thought than others; thus, by omitting social desires one may acquire more room for other focus of thought, albeit some desires may be stubborn due to some form of unconscious conditioning).  For the latter, it would need to be something that breaks that stubborn desire and replaces it with what one may deem to be a more productive focus.

Anyways, apologies if this is posted in the wrong sub-reddit - not entirely sure where to post this.  And lastly, I'm not suggesting the completely omission of social activity but rather to replace social desires which were conditioned by pleasurable social experiences such that one becomes more focused on what they consciously deem to be more productive.  Perhaps even to extend this to even allow for greater flexibility such that they may quickly adjust.

It is a very common thing for people with depression to lose interest in hobbies and activities they previously enjoyed. It really is frustrating, especially when you find something you're enjoying and then some little thing kind of triggers a rush of negative thoughts.

I work part-time, and I don't know if I enjoy it, but it's calming because I work in an auto body repair shop and I can just kind of lose myself in what I'm doing. Reddit is the same way, I just kind of get lost in the endless amount of posts and it just takes me away from my own thoughts and worries. Once or twice a week I go to my friend's house, which is not as fun as it used to be, but I still enjoy it because we have good conversation and my friends make me laugh.

I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the same feeling you get. I'm thinking of the feeling of someone or something completely ruining an activity for me with something they said or something I messed up. Driving, for example. I will hesitate too long even though I know where I'm going and I'll miss the turn. That makes me mad at myself because I know I missed that turn because I didn't want to slow down at the wrong street and inconvenience the person behind me but I made this tiny thing that normal people don't think about into a bigger thing and now I'm late for my appointment because I have to turn around somewhere that I won't inconvenience anyone.

43151,,True,MacBeth_in_Yellow,,,,"Yeah, I didn't care much for counselors when I was your age either. I started seeing one about a year ago, and it's gone pretty well, but I had to overcome some pretty serious prejudices before I could convince myself to go. Originally I went for my ADD instead and deliberately avoided bringing up the depression.

I went through a pretty bad depression when I was 22; I'm currently 36. I came pretty close to suicide a few times, even writing countless notes. Like you, the fear of crippling myself kept me from going through with it; I couldn't stand the idea of having to live my life with brain damage or being confined to a wheelchair, as being depressed was bad enough. That, and I suspect that most people who want to kill themselves likely go through a very sudden change of heart in the middle of the act, and that *scares the living shit out of me.*

I don't know what the answer is to severe depression; I'm taking an SSRI right now and I do have my doubts as to whether or not it will really work. The only thing I can say is that depression is a disorder, and it's doing a lot of the thinking for you right now. Fight it. If you must succumb to anything, succumb to the urge to sleep. I'm going through a low point right now, and I can easily sleep for twelve hours straight if I let myself do it. At least with sleep, you'll have the option of waking up later.

I have been feeling pretty shitty these days and I feel overwhelmed with everything.  I have a short temper that affects my relationships.  Usually what happens is something upsets me and I fly off the deep end.  I will shout, smash things.  I can't control my emotions and I can't express myself.  I then usually shut down after and stay in bed all day and never get out. I get so angry that my life isn't how it is and I feel that people that have worked less hard than me have lucked out and got the life I wanted. I tell myself I probably don't deserve better.  I can't be rational with my circumstances.  This anger/ withdrawal has happened lots with my partner and a few times with his friends over.  I feel defeated and shutting myself out can last up to a day or two.  I don't have many friends,  I get extremely anxious with large groups especially people from work or school and I constantly feel judged and always feel like people don't like me.  I am so uncomfortable.  I have never had many friends and I was bullied in school when I was younger and in university I never got along with anyone and would usually make an ass of myself cause of presenting in front of large groups and saying really stupid things unintentionally because of being so nervous and others would call me retarded and not want to work with me. Even with all that I was able to graduate with my degree but I still feel dumb and not proud.
Anyway,  I have started seeing a therapist and plan on talking with my doctor.  I am moving to a new town and the stress with that is horrible and I feel like everything is going to shit.  I talked to my mom who also has these anger outbursts and she  told me that she has gone on medication for it and that I should think of doing it too as anxiety runs in the family and said it took her 50 years to realize this isn't normal.
I work with people with mental health and I get it, but I always think that my problems are not as bad as theirs.  I want to start fresh in the new place I am going and not feel like no one likes me.
I want to get help but my partner is 100% against me taking anything and it makes me feel like I am a crazy person. I am afraid of side effects where I would get weight gain and not be desirable and am afraid of lowered sex drive as that is already an issue in m relationship.

I know its tough, but friends can make a wonderful difference :). Don't give in to despair and lean on your family and friends. It can make the world of difference to just talk it out. This kind of thing happens to heaps of different people but at least in my opinion, being angry at her helps in the short term but can negatively change your view on relationships in general, which in my opinion is not worth it. Realise that this is a step in life, and it will get better. This is my first Christmas without my ex of 5 years! So I know how painful it can get. Try not to dwell on it though and realise you have many more Christmases to spend with someone. Believe in yourself! Be that confident guy that she fell in love with in the first place!

So, being really good at thinking introduces a cognitive trap where you start believing the simulations (thoughts) over reality.  Your body reacts accordingly, and emotions arise.  If your thoughts tend towards the negative, then negative emotions arise, which fuels depression.  The remedy, of course, is to question your thoughts, get out of your brilliant mind every once in a while and back into reality.

Next time you feel like you're getting depressed, check your thoughts.  It's always interesting to see how much of a role they can play.

16655,,True,TheStreisandEffect,,,,"Thank you for such a detailed response. And actually almost every doctor that has seen me has said something similar about my case being really unusual and specific. (Especially with the buzzing/pressure sensation) I suppose they could be labeled invasive thoughts, the difference being, they come on so strong they will completely remove my perception of reality and put me into a terrifying deep state of derealization (sometimes for days at a time.)

As for drugs, I tried Celexa years ago for the depression and it gave me a seizure, so I became terrified of anti-depressants. Well last year after my breakdown, I decided to give it another go: a few days on wellbutrin and I wanted to die. Then I tried Lexapro and it fucked me up so bad I didn't even feel like I existed anymore and it's honestly when the ""realization"" that I don't actually control my own thoughts first hit me. My pdoc wouldn't give me a benzo to help adjust to the drug either and after 2 months of hell I told him I was quitting it because my mind was such a wreck. Finally I found a GP who gave me a Klonopin script but I've been very careful with it because I noticed after just a couple months of only taking .5 day, that I had horrible anxiety if I missed even one dose. 

So now I'm trying to break clean, and just focus on diet, exercise, and cutting sugar as I've heard that helps immensely. But the looping thought issue has just been a constant thorn as of lately. What you're saying makes sense, but at the same time, what I have hard time doing is separating ""my thoughts"" from ""me"" cause like you said, ""The mind is a collection of complex things"" and the thought that uncontrollable looping thoughts are just a part of ""me"" is pretty fucking scary. (Although I guess ""me"" resides in a different part of the brain).

But thank you for everything you shared. I do appreciate it and I'll look into the Internal Family Systems Model. It sounds like I need to figure out a way to separate my thoughts from my self even though I feel like I have a hard time doing that because they're part of the same brain and knowing that makes me feel like even the concept of ""I"" is an illusion.

Right now I feel like I'm stuck in some sort of limbo with school. I haven't been to class in weeks and any hope of salvaging my grades is dwindling by the day. I totally get where you're coming from with the pre-class anxiety. I've been through it all--the nausea, the anxiety, the stomach cramps. I've taken the one-hour train ride to campus only to turn around and head back home immediately after coming out of the station. It's horrible. Every morning it's been taking me longer and longer to get out of bed. I've tried everything--exercise, eating healthy, meds--and nothing's worked. I've been procrastinating emailing my professors after missing papers and exams. The only advice I can offer you on that front is that most of the time professors are very understanding. However, it's best to get in touch with them as early as possible. 

As for psychologists, I have the exact same problem of not being able to open up to them. I have so much in my head that I want to scream out, but when it comes to actually talking I really downplay it and make things seem more okay than they really are. Don't beat yourself up over it. It takes a lot for someone with anxiety and depression to able to open up to a complete stranger. One suggestion I've seen is to write down everything you want to say in a letter and give it to your psychologist to read instead of saying it out loud. I've haven't tried it, but I imagine it would be easier to communicate your thoughts that way.

Lately life has been REALLY hard and I feel like everything has been adding up at an alarming rate. To make things worse I feel like I've lost all of my support systems. I'll try to expand.

Three years ago I relocated to a new city where I knew only two people. Since then I've not made any friends. When I first moved I had a terrible job and lived in a shit studio apartment that shared common areas with a business. Things got better for a while...but now I feel like I'm falling backwards and there has been no progress. I got a great, easy, well paying job and my SO and I moved in together about a year ago (with other roommates). But three months after I got hired, the store shut down and only gave me 3 days notice before they were closing. I now work at a coffee shop. I bust my ass every single night and feel like crying because I'm 26 with a college degree and I work in a fucking coffee shop. I constantly am looking and interviewing at other places however the last two interviews I went on, I thought went extremely well and then I was told they were hiring someone else instead....and then I found the position reposted, like they just hated me that much. 

Our apartment is awful. One of our roommates ended up moving out, another moved in his previously homeless mother and living at our place has been HELL because of this. They are all crazy and I actually ended up having to give up my studio (one of the spare rooms that I was paying for) to move someone else in to help pay rent. This was one of the last things I really looked forward to, and I had to give it up. 

Last month I was held up at gunpoint and robbed on our front doorstep. 

We have been desperately trying to find a new place and NOTHING has come up. We fell in love with one apartment and our application was then denied. Because of this, in a week we will be moving in with my SO's parents. Most of our belongings will be going into storage. I'm very grateful for them letting us do this, however it is of course humiliating and not ideal. Not to mention their house is a 2 hour transit time from both of our jobs (we take public transportation). 

Now normally throughout all of this I would have my SO and my parents (who live 5 states away) to at least talk to about this. But I've recently lost these lifelines:

My parents have always been terrible with money and I love them dearly but this is part of the reason why I don't live with them anymore. During us looking for an apartment I actually loaned my parents HALF of my total savings so that THEY could move. Meanwhile they can offer me no help. They also SWORE to me they would pay me back a week later, after my dad got paid, however they can't. And won't. I'll probably never see that money again. Because of this I just can't call them anymore. I know it hurts me more than them, not talking, but I feel betrayed and defeated and can't bare calling them right now.

My SO has always been there for me. And while it took him a while to understand how depression works (not just telling me to 'cheer up') He's done a really good job at learning and trying to deal with me. I really appreciate this. We've been together 3 years, and last week I discovered accounts on tons of websites where he was talking inappropriately  to other women, collecting their nude photos, etc. I was absolutely heartbroken. I never expected that from him. We had a huge fight and he was crying and begging for my forgiveness. I drank an entire bottle of wine for myself, threw it at our TV (breaking it), and spent most of that night throwing up and crying in the toilet. I made him sleep on the couch for a few days but eventually let him back in our room. I'm trying to let our relationship get back to normal and he definitely KNOWS he fucked up but it's really hard. Everything is not okay. And I have no choice but to go through with this move to his parents anyway, I have nowhere else to go. 

I just feel completely defeated. Everything that could possibly have gone wrong has, and NOTHING is giving me a shred of hope or support to go on. I really just don't know what to do anymore. I've had depression for years now and I've done a pretty good job and remaining functional but lately, it's just too fucking much. I don't know what to do. I want to die. I just want everything to stop. I'm tired of this uphill battle with everything. No matter how hard I try and what I do I keep getting pushed back down. Why bother trying anymore when the result is the same either way? ",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,default,Not sure where else to turn...I've lost my support systems.

If I look thru my text message log for October, I have text chats from 13 or 14 different friends, but most of them are fairly impersonal.

Pre-cellphone and pre-texting, I used to routinely get phone calls from these people. The connection was deeper by talking with someone. Texting is so lazy and so impersonal.

I don't write anymore, I'm too sad. Too hurt. I have no reason to play music, no one's going to hear it anyway. I lost all of my ""friends"" because they weren't good for me in the long run, but now I feel as though I have no one to talk to, no one to pick my heart up from the floor, even though they might never know that they were the only thing standing between my body and the edge of the overpass. 



My relationship with my girlfriend seems great some days. I love her family and her animals. We cuddle and do cute couple things. She's not really interested in the books I read or the my opinion on the last album I listened to on YouTube, though. I wish she was, sometimes. I wish someone was. But the few friends I've made at school, well, they're female, and I don't want her to get mad at me for talking to them, so I don't. And she does get mad, so I respect her opinion because I don't want to hurt anyone. It's kind of narcissistic in a funny way. I just don't want to hurt them because it always hurts me back, you know? I guess that's selfish, yeah? But I guess I should allow myself to be selfish sometimes. I don't know. Maybe not. 

I stopped smoking, stopped drinking. Stopped drinking soda. Started drinking water. Lots of it. I even exercise sometimes, but it's hard to feel driven enough, I guess. 

Oh, I fell in love with tea. I really like this Earl Grey stuff I found in Walmart. It kind of reminds me of when my grandmother used to make tea when we were kids, but she's gone, and she can't even make her own tea now. Parkinson's is really such an ugly way to see someone so wonderful waste away. And I won't see her again. But I know she's where she wants to be. So I'm happy for her, because I love her. 

I don't know. I just can't even make anyone happy. I just feel burdensome to everyone. My girlfriend paid for our dates a few times the past few months because I'm out of work for awhile, trying to do 19 hrs of classes in college to graduate on time in two years. And our two years anniversary is coming up, and I have no money for that or Valentines day or her birthday, and she likes to talk about marriage, but I know I won't be able to afford that for a really long time, either. Those dates, though. That made me feel like less of a man, if I ever was one. I guess. I never really felt like one, really. Just a bag of sad and sickly meat that had gone bad, but no one wanted to throw it away, because surely it's worth *something*, right?

I just don't want to live here anymore. I just want to die. But I think I might make some people sad. Maybe. I'm not sure, really. But I don't want to hurt anyone, so I don't. I'm not scared of dying. Kind of ready, willing even. But like I said, I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. So I just stay on this Earth. It feels more like an uncomfortable purgatory state than anything. Constantly. All the time, really.

I don't know. Sorry for being so long-winded, guys. I might post this to some more subs. Sorry if I seem attention-starved or something, or if my problems aren't really serious enough. I've seen some of you guys and gals around here with some really big problems and I wish I could take your pain away. I'm sure you're all wonderful strangers, and I hope your hurting ceases soon. I hope all of ours does. I don't really want any of us to feel sad or unwanted. But we've all got our place in the world, right? I don't know. Maybe not.

But now I don't know if being alone is helping me feel better or making my depression worse. I used to be convinced of the latter. I'm actually a really friendly person. Most people who know me can vouch for that. But over the last year or so, I started finding social interaction so exhausting. I really wanted to put myself out there because I was just tired of the isolation and feeling of emptiness. 

I notice that people only approach me when they want something from me. I assume it's probably because I look a lot younger than my age so they think I'm easy to fool. (I don't look any different from when I was in high school but I've lived through a lot of things.) I'm not dumb enough to not see that. A year of trying to be social and meet new people and change things has not helped me one bit. The more I talk to people, the more I find reasons to stop trying to be go out there and meet new people. 

At this point, I think I'm a little more satisfied with being alone. It's miserable but frankly, it's better than wading through the sea of pretense, and being sociable, laughing at things that aren't funny, and smiling at people you don't really like. I do enough of that work and I don't need to do that outside of it.

This honestly sounds more like what happened. I'm kind of beyond admitting that because a parent has difficulties in circumstances in life that it automatically takes away all the abuse that they have given to their child. I think if a parent knows they're fucked up, and have a children.. that's just beyond selfish. But I don't know your mom, and I shouldn't pass judgement so easily.. I'm just someone who has a mother who has some very observable difficulties, but also hurts the people around her without trying to alleviate her problems first.. thus giving some kind of closure and respect for her to those around her.

Honestly, with these kinds of problems that stem from a parent.. I think the best thing to do would be to break away from said parent, at least for a while. Try to talk to her as little as possible and clear your head. 

You need to really understand that your mistrust of therapists and other professionals does not necessarily come from those professions themselves.. But your mother's association with them. You have to understand also, that many people have difficulties with those kinds of professionals, but that it is a case by case basis, meaning that the responsibility is up to the individual. It's not up to the school or doctrine that they follow. You need to somehow separate your experience with your mother as a therapist and her influence on the doctors and therapists that you've seen, from every other doctor and therapist out there. Because what it comes down to, is that these professionals are the ones most qualified to help you. You can read self help books all day, but you are ultimately need someone to guide you through your processes of panic, anxiety, and abuse, in order to get better.

You have to keep that fact solid in your mind, and not stray from it. If you don't get over your fears, your son could very well go through the same problems that you are facing now. Break the cycle.

This is going to be a jumbled rant most likely, so bear with me please. I have been having issues for as long as I can remember. Right now, I feel like nothing is going my way and never will. Maybe it's my fault, maybe not. Maybe it's a little of both, I don't know anymore. A couple years ago I went into an inpatient program and was diagnosed with bipolar. I don't know if that is the correct label, but whatever is wrong with me, it has completely drained me. I am tired of trying to connect with people, they all leave in the end. I feel like when I open up completely, I lose people. Nobody seems to want to deal with me. I am such a burden. I don't know if it's mental illness or truly my personality. I can't remember a time where people liked me. I was bullied in elementary school and onward. I have been called every name under the sun. I act like it doesn't bother me but after twenty years of people being blatantly mean or just plain ignoring me, it's hard not to think that the problem is me. At 26 years old, I am afraid I can't change anymore and I will always be the annoying girl looking for attention. 

My parents tell me they love me, and maybe they do, but if they knew the true me, they would be ashamed and embarrassed. I still cut myself. I still do drugs. These things are the only things I know to use to not feel so fucking lonely all the time. Tonight, I tried to get a little weed, and even my drug dealers find me so annoying that they didn't even text back. I have never done anything wrong. One of them recently told me that the problem they have with me is simply that I'm around. That hurts. Most people would say ""That's not somebody you should worry about then"", but it's not that simple. It's still a person. I am a people-pleaser and every person who doesn't like me is somebody I simply couldn't make happy which equates to failure in my mind. That's an incorrect thought process, but it is mine and hurts all the same.

I'm thinking about suicide AGAIN. It's so exhausting. I probably won't do it, as I tend to get many ideas and never follow through, but that doesn't mean the pain is not as real. 

I have one person in my life that I can be 100% myself with. He is 1000 miles away. I can't even keep myself together long enough to get my shit straight up here so I can move to him. Even still, I know I would have these same thoughts at some point.

So why don't I go to the doctor you ask? Because I fail at that too. The last time I had a psychiatrist, they broke up with me. That's right, I'm too much of a hassle for someone to deal with even when I pay them too. I don't have health insurance as I am still on my probationary period for my current employer (still have one more month to go). I am still in debt from my previous hospital stays. It so hard to get help for mental issues and I don't understand it. I feel like my only option is to lock myself up for life, but that's not what anybody really wants. I feel so helpless against the forces of the world. I always have and I don't know if it will ever change. I'm so lost.

Are you at a state school or something? Are you in grad school, or are you an undergrad? Are you in any clubs? (I met a lot of people in college through clubs!) I don't think tutoring is going to net very many friendships, as there's a professional barrier involved with that.

Are you in the city? Strangely enough I've never been (even though I lived in Boston and near Albany!) but it's a *huge* frikken city. What are your interests? Since trying to talk to ""random"" people hasn't worked for you (nor me), what about specific events where socialization is possible? Two of my loves are craft beer (foofy beer drinkers are crazy friendly) and music (I attend and/or perform at small venues, get to meet a lot of like-minded people). I just joined a dodgeball league! (Though that specifically seems like an LA thing more than a NY thing.)

It's noble what you're doing for those students, but what about a more social oriented means of volunteering? Where you'd be able to interact with other volunteers?

I'm weird too... and my best strategy has always been to own my weirdness. All my friends seem to have some sort of quirk. I tend to mainly associate with really intelligent people. I would think that you would have a similar strategy. This is why I gave you the ""pursue your interests"" spiel above.

Push come to shove... leave the city. Maybe this just isn't a good environment for you?

You also have the MFT option, and that might help answer this question. Though in general, it's because you're socially inexperienced. People like you and I have to play catch-up, unfortunately.

I can guarantee that this is false. If they are decent people, they will notice.  Let me tell you a story: I had a friend, a real close one mind you, that was going through shit similar to you. He was bright, athletic, funny, just an all-around good person. But, he was going through a deep depression. It started with small things, like not wanting to leave the house.  Then it progressed to self-harm.  One day, about a year an a half of fighting depression, he decided he was done. He killed himself half way through our junior year of high school. He was a good student, 4.0 GPA, varsity athlete... He had everything going for him, and he decided to throw it all away. Not one fucking day goes by where I don't think of him, all the great memories we had. This was 6 years ago. Not a single day in six years have I ever forgot about him. Think about that. 0 out of the ~2190 days have I ever forgotten. You're giving yourself less credit than you should; you are noticed, and you won't be forgotten if you ever disappeared.

Ok so first thing, I [F in my 20s] am in a relationship with my SO [M+/-25] since a year or so. We live in different country with a big time zone difference. I try to stay blur for the same reason I use a throwaway, but I try to give you information so you are able to see the situation as much as possible.

-------
Our relationship began in a pretty awesome way, but lately have been tough. I guess, after the ""honey moon"" time and due to the distance it's pretty normal. But we made it and it's been better.

I am having an hard time now, but it's more deep and personnal. Cause in his side everything is great : He now have a job, live with friends... When before he was in a bad period (parent's house all the time without seeing anybody, no job, or money.) So we was used to spend ALOT of time together. Sleeping on Skype, etc etc. Now, we cannot cause internet will be too expensive for him. We don't do cam cause he doesn't have one anymore. And the amount of time together is alot reduce because of works, friends, etc. Wich I totally understand and I'm fine with.

Today, we talked about our future. I begun this, because of a post on r/longdistance. We have the same goal and the same dream (wich is awesome and rare, I value it). But I guess I was in a little utopic way to see things and he was more realistic. He told me it'll take some years for us to be together but that's what he want and he is ready to wait for that. I just imagined that we'll close the distance sooner, but again, I know it's kind of utopic. So this talk just hit me a little I guess.

Also, lately I personally feel really down. I don't do anything of my day... Despite the fact that I need to do alot of things (study, clean, I also want to workout my body). I am in my 2nd year of psychology licence, and I completely fail my year, only because I missed alot of class... Classes are interesting but I cannot find sleep, and the morning is the worst part, I am so exhausted that I only want one thing : Staying in bed. I know I could succeed if only I wasn't such a selfish pussy. I know that I'll completely disappoint my parents by failing school and I also know that I'll never tell them that it's probably cause I feel not great, because they'll not get it, and I'll feel like I lie. I selfishly wish my bf could support me but... He don't seem to do it, or see, or care ? I dunno. I tried yesterday to tell him that I think about trying to take vitamines. But he was distract and just don't want to talk about ""heavy stuff"" lately. On the same time I don't want to need him to feel better, shit, I should be able to feel better by myself, I'm not that weak... But I guess I am. When he was in his hard part, I really did my best to help him. By taking his timezone rythm, by encouraging him, reassuring and be positive. Also do the ""mom"" sometimes and push him to go for a walk, to search work, etc. I did that naturally cause I care about him. But now that he feel better, I have the feeling that he is not caring anymore about me. (It's a feeling* I don't say he don't). When I tell him I don't feel great he is just saying ""It's ok, it'll be fine"" but generally not more...

And I feel like I am just complaining here. Blah. It's pretty messy in my mind.

About the vitamines thing : I just know that if you are not good physically, you end up feeling sad, lazy, etc (it already happend to me). And I know for sure that I am in that right now. Because I have trouble with food (since my all life, nothing to do with him or that), and I have not enough vitamines or iron. Also, maybe because I am again in his timezone (due to holidays), I pretty much live the night so maybe not enough sun.

-------
I don't even know what I really want by saying all that. You'll probably tell me to go talk to him about that but the thing is, I am pretty sure he'll not listen/realize. And anyway, I should just feel better on my own probably, no ? What do you guys think about all that ? What could I do because I feel like he maybe be tired of me unhappy (and I am tired of myself anyway)

Thanks if you are reading this, to take your time for a complete stranger. Sorry if the whole text is messy and have no organisation. Also, I am French, so sorry for the shitty English.

I don't even know if it's the right subreddit. Cause I don't know if I really am depressed (it's a big word to me). But I really feel stuck in a down spot and feel without any energy to get out. But the worse part is that I am aware that I waste my time, but don't do anything to change it.

Lyrics:

I'm tired of waking up in tears,
'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain;
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
I'm sick of the past I can't erase,
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace,
The mountains of things that I still regret,
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

If you no longer have insurance and are concerned about the cost of seeing your doctor you can try a clinic. Many clinic nurse practitioners are comfortable writing prescriptions for anti-depressant medications. You may also be able to save money by asking your doc/nurse to write you 90-day prescriptions rather than 30-day prescriptions. It will cost you more upfront to fill, but you can save money on the total prescription cost as 90-day prescriptions are often offered at a discount.

One more tip - Celexa is the same as Lexapro, but at half the dose. Celexa is available in a generic form so you can fill your prescriptions for just $5.00. If you are taking 15 mg of Lexapro, you should be prescribed 30 mg of Celexa to have the same effect.

I just finished my PhD, have a great job, and have some good friends, yet I still feel the dull ache of depression.  I am lucky that my depression is a low-grade kind, which sounds like yours, and does not necessarily result in suicidal thoughts.  But it is still depression nonetheless and it affects my life.

I go through this alot.  Some times there are trigger events and some times there aren't.  In some ways, it actually helps to know that the onset is sometimes out of my control.  What is in my control is what to do about it.  And I am going to start talk therapy again.  Even if it is for just a little while, I know that I'm doing something about it.  Your history in the military actually will help the therapist help you actually as many therapists specialize in helping people in the military.  I know nothing about PTSD or if you've been in a combat zone, but you probably do want to talk to a professional, just to make sure.  

No matter what, you need to do something, whether it be professional therapy or getting a physical or trying to change up your routine.  The thing about this low-grade depression is that it can mushroom into something more severe if you leave it untreated.  What you're doing here, trying to work out in your head what is going on and acknowledging that it is a problem is good.  But it's just the first step.

Since then I've been on sertraline for the day and mirtazipine to help me sleep (although I stopped taking it as it contributes to weight gain). I'm overweight and have a large waist that I hate looking at, seeing myself in the mirror I just end up being upset with myself.

Admittedly my situation has improved greatly since then. I no longer self harm, I am no longer in an environment which causes me to get overly upset and paranoid and I'm back to doing physical exercise.

However my life lacks any semblance of meaning. I have nothing which makes me feel like my life is important or anything that makes me feel happy and I feel like my life is just going to fade into an inconsequential nothingness.

I hardly ever go outside, I don't do anything special or noteworthy and I have NEVER felt like I was fitting in with whatever anyone else is doing.

The only thing I really do is play video games and watch pro wrestling because it puts me in a situation where I don't need to think about the outside world or my bland and inconsequential life. In video games I can at least put myself in the shoes of something interesting. I'm even starting to fall out of love with pro wrestling, with it looking like a big phase which I suddenly fell into, I don't feel like I love it as genuinely as all the others do and I can hardly get myself excited about it.

I can barely sleep and I'm always unhappy. I can't look at myself and think 'you're worth something. You matter'. I just end up staying indoors for weeks on end wasting away doing nothing.

5019,,True,Uphoria,,,,"This may sound totally heartless, but give up on him. You have tried and tried to make it work, but he is self destructive, and tearing you down. If he doesn't know its hurting you, he is not even listening to you. 

If your health has been impacted this severly and you are not married, why stick by his side. Mental abuse is just as evil as Physical abuse. He is leading you down a road of disablement for your entire life, leaving you feeling as if you are the cause.

At the risk of sounding sexist, I have known many women whom think it is their duty to fix someone, the nurturing instinct to save them and make them well. This helps lead to a viscous cycle of ""But I am just not trying hard enough to make it right"" instead of the more correct ""I have done more than is enough, its a lost cause."" 

My sister was in a phyiscally and mentally abusive relationship. To this day, what gets her more than anything is the insecurity he put in her. It took years of counceling to get her out of her self destructive behaviors. He hit her, and she said she made him angry. He called her worthless, and she believed him. In the end, its all the same. She was always the one feeling bad, while he didn't care.

Don't just leave in the night though. Build a good strategy. Know where you are going, what you will do, and get some friends to back you up after its over. You won't feel good. You will feel worse for a while. it will suck. There is nothing you can do to skip that part, but you can make it easier. You will feel a ton better after that bit. 

After you have a set plan, give him the ultimatum. Say he is either going to work toward this relationship or end it. Make it his choice. Why? Because you want to let him know how much you have cared, and how little he has responded with. This will let him know that he is causing the problems. If it doesn't make him imediatly about-face then leave. Don't accept ""I'll think about it""s or any other dismissive comments. Its either - he does, or he doesn't. If its clear he doesn't want to get better, than leave. If he can't open up to you even though you know about it, he isn't someone who you really want to trust as the closest friend, and share an intimate mental bond with. 

Please, Don't let yourself be dragged down by his behavior. A relationship is a two way street. I hate it when I see women compromising their happiness and self worth for someone. You are just as important as him.

I don't know, I get emotional when I deal with abusive relationships, so TLDR - Make a plan, give him the final choice, and walk immediately if he turns you down. If he does anything that you might fear aggressive, have someone close by to keep you safe (in numbers). Make sure to seek some form of counseling after this. This way you can sort out your feelings, and come to terms.

100433,,True,aquamantis,,,,"I know exactly what you mean. I'm instantly drawn to songs that are kind of sombre in melody or sad in lyrics. Even if it's a relatively upbeat band, I always gravitate to the more mellow songs on the album.

Some of my favorite bands/artists that I listen to in excess, particularly when I'm feeling down, are Sufjan Stevens, Neutral Milk Hotel/Jeff Mangum, Arthur Russel, and Bon Iver. Rather than upset me even further, listening to these artists gives me a bit of hope. I'm so used to always wanting to voice my thoughts, and then feeling like I have to mute myself because people are so easily discomfited by the acknowledgement of the lonelier aspects of being alive. Hearing other people voice feelings similar to what I'm experiencing, but never hear voiced outside of myself, makes me feel a little bit less alone.

Jeff Mangum in particular has taught me so much—how to love, how to feel so inherently with no shame. Listening to In the Aeroplane always leads me to draw new conclusions depending on what stage I am at in my life, even if it's just a few days apart. [Two Headed Boy Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gkAF5_UOj8) in particular always takes a lot out of me. Despite the sombre mood of a lot of these songs, I understand them, and I understand the person that is singing. It feels romantic to me, it makes me feel that everyone should embrace their love this intensely.

Another song that has really helped me in the past year is [Now That I'm Older](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GskYX6AdfyU) by Sufjan Stevens. So much of this song feels like a part of me.

But that doesn't excuse giving out such bad information. 

Depression is very complex. We don't know how complex. We don't know if depression is one *thing*, one cohesive syndrome, or a lot of different *things* that are outwardly similar. We don't know if serotonin is particularly relevant, but someone found a way to effect it and it seemed to help depression in some people, so we continued in that vein.

Dump your friends, if you are just a dollar sign to be cashed in at the right time to them, it isn't worth being friends with them.

Therapists are helpful under the following circumstances:
1. You are dealing with some sort of mental instablility.
2. You are actively looking for a solution to that problem.
3. You don't mind telling your deepest darkest secrets to a complete stranger that is bound by law to keep them.

Number 3 is crucial though, If you think that seeing a therapist is a good option then do it, but don't hold anything back. tell them exactly what you are thinking. tell them how you feel. use that oily brush to paint them the picture that your emotions make you feel with words (or brushes and paint if your really enjoy doing that).

I know what it is like to be depressed beyond the point that someone can handle it. I know what it feels like to be bedridden everyday barely able to get out of bed after 4 hours of being awake. I know what it feels like to feel so bad that all i wanted to do was to is go downstairs, grab a kitchen knife and stab myself until I would slowly and painfully bleed out.

I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy.
I have a friend that isn't reliable, but he isn't a traitor at the same time. I don't particularly like him, I don't really want to maintain a relationship with him for the rest of my life. In fact, I don't think I ever want to see him ever again.

Do any of those experiences sound pleasant to you?
I didn't think so. My job isn't to scare you. My job isn't to come at you and tell you that you are going to die a very very slow and painful death from anxiety/depression. What I am here to tell you is, Personal change comes from within. If you want to feel better, than everyday it is your job to make one step closer to treatment and one step outside your comfort zone. One step outside your comfort zone means going outside to your closest collection of people and socialize. This doesn't mean a rave, this doesn't mean a house party. This means going out to your local grocery store and helping a old lady cross the street. this means going to an old folks home and talking with them about their past experiences.

**Drugs.**
This is the part to pay attention if you have been skimming.
Drugs are not to be fucked with.
Drugs if used correctly can be great and fun or can completely destroy your body and your mind. If you like smoking weed or drinking, great. but mixed with depression that can turn into a high chaser phase that will leave you feeling worthless and empty. Its never a good idea to use opioids, they will leave you wanting to up the anti.

I would certainly appreciate it if you used some of your 'brilliance' and got some money in your overdrawn checking account! It is affecting our credit!
 
Me September 26 at 6:11am
[Step-mom], I love you beyond any measure, but I won't use sarcasm in my response regardless if did.

The overdrawn checking account isn't affecting your credit. I don't like the overdraft anymore than you do, but an overdrawn checking account doesn't reflect on a credit report. The only way it would ever be sent to a credit report is if the account was sent to collections, which I know for a fact it has not been. Credit reports and scores don't contain any evidence of banking activities whatsoever. 

I'd love to use my so called 'brilliance' to fix the situation, but I can't. I'm barely stringing by on paying my bills. Moreover, I can't switch over my direct deposit because OSI decided to disable my DOD computer accounts when they did their investigation, and the Air Force refuses to re-instantiate the accounts because I'm so close to discharge. 

I know this is inconvenient for you guys, but if you can't stand the fact that your names are on the account I use mainly until I get out of the Air Force, you can get me switched over to the primary account holder and I can remove your names from the account. I asked a banker about it three or four months ago, it's easily done. Probably over the phone.

Either way, I'm sorry about the overdrafts. 

Love,

[Me]

We also met with a banker a couple of months ago. It is not as easy as you make it sound, and it does affect our credit. You think you can outsmart us and the rest of the world. Well, young man, by now I would think you would have learned the hard lesson that you can't. I'm very tired of all of it.

I'm not trying to outsmart anyone [Step-Mom].

Here's some references to the credit rating:

http://www.ehow.com/facts_5700629_bank-fees-effect-credit-rating.html

Look, I'm also tired about carrying on with this stuff. If you guys want to close the account, do it. I can get a check from the Air Force if it comes to that, even if it comes a few weeks late. I'm not trying to 'outsmart' anyone.

I'm going to be honest. If you talked to a banker and he told you it would affect your credit score, he was wrong. Really wrong. S/he may be a banker, but they obviously don't know anything about a credit score and reporting. I've never missed an overdraft that has resulted in a collection on your guys accounts. On my account before I joined the Air Force? Sure. That screwed over my credit score. My other choices I've made since then have also screwed me over. I'm not financially responsible, but I know for a FACT that I have not influenced your credit score, at least since I've joined the Air Force.

I know that when you log into wf.com and see a negative balance, it worries you. I don't want it any more than you. I'm not even going to try to explain why it happens, because that would sound like an excuse.

If you want to close the account when it's positive, which should be Thursday morning, go ahead.

I'm a shitty son, I know that. That isn't an invitation for sympathy; I simply have underperformed to any reasonable standards. I'm 23, getting kicked out of the Air Force because I'm mentally unstable, and can't handle my finances. But if you think for a second I'm trying to fucking 'outsmart' anyone right now, you're mistaken. I'm just trying to get by, and doing it the best I can. I know that doesn't meet your expectations, but frankly, I have to look out for myself now. I love you, but the stress with dealing with you and dad is getting to the point that I just can't do it right now.

Talk to a better banker. One who knows what the hell he is talking about. Close the account as soon as the balance is positive, and I'll deal with the consequences.

I know it is totally a cliche but love will find its way in when you stop looking for it.  That's how I met my amazing ex.  I told myself, and truly believed, that I was going to be okay on my own, that I didn't need someone in my life right now.  

I think what that cliche gets at is confidence and self acceptance. When you are confident that you are your own person, that you are self sufficient, that you are mostly doing alright, you become more open to meeting new people and going out on a limb here and there.  

A bit of practical advice for you: check out online chat rooms.  Not dating sites, just chat rooms.  Talk to new people, throw out a few hooks and maybe someone will bite.  You might not get a relationship out of the process but you'll surely come out with some new friends.

It didn't go so great and I've been feeling extra depressed and worthless because of it.

At the age of 24, I've just had my first ever job interview. I have a Masters degree now, and I've left university, so I've run out of excuses to  not apply for jobs. I rarely ever apply for jobs because I feel like I'm worthless and I'll never be good at anything. I have absolutely no value to anyone, and I've been living off my parents and off student loans for the past few years. I have a bad case of social anxiety and I often don't leave the house at all for weeks at a time, unless I absolutely need to. In the past few years, I'd mostly only ever leave the house to attend classes and exams at my university because I often don't even want to be *seen* by anyone, not even neighbours. Now that Uni is off the table, I've been almost entirely housebound since December 2014. I can hardly talk to/deal with people, and the thought of facing a job interview has always terrified me, more so the longer I've gone on without having ever been interviewed, and without any real work experience besides university projects.

A week ago, I submitted my first batch of job interviews since completing my Masters degree and for the first time ever, I actually got a call. I guess the Masters qualification really is worth something. I was in a state of panic when I suddenly found myself in the middle of a phone interview, and after answering all the questions I was asked to the best of my ability, I was invited to come to an actual interview, which was today.

I went and had the interview. I'm sorry to say it didn't go so great. I was quite nervous, and they didn't ask any of the ""common interview questions"" people are always advised to prepare for, so a lot of questions caught me off guard and I started struggling with feelings of anxiety the longer the interview went on. Even though the interviewers were friendly and personable, I felt like running from the room and hiding myself away somewhere. I'm pretty sure I came across as a socially awkward, dysfunctional idiot, and I've been lying in bed since coming home from the interview hours ago, not moving, not doing anything. I almost feel traumatised, as pathetic as that sounds. I can't bring myself to get up and try to function because I feel like my worthlessness has been confirmed by the job interview. I'll always be a loser. I'll never be good enough to work anywhere for anyone. I'll never amount to anything. I felt like crying earlier, now I just feel numb. 

So yeah, that's been my experience with my first ever job interview. I know I'm worthless, so you don't have to rub it in. I just wanted to let someone know how I'm feeling.

I take solace in knowing I'm probably going to commit suicide when I turn 30. I've come up with this plan as a pact with myself to just endure and try my best for just a little while longer, but my 30th birthday in May 2020 is my expiry date. The world will be better off without me. I wish I weren't so fucking pathetic. I wish I wasn't broken.

It's been like this ever since I was diagnosed 11 years ago. I can remember the feeling of alienation and loneliness, even though I somehow managed to make friends up through college (now I don't have any friends at all).

I didn't feel like I fit in with the community. I didn't feel like I fit in with the people I hung out with. Either they didn't understand my depression, or we were just too different, or I was the ""once in a while friend"".

My romantic relationships always fall apart.

I want to give up. Throw in the towel and accept the fact that maybe there is no place in this world for me.

But I can't stop daydreaming, wishing, wanting.

I want to just move somewhere new. 

I don't like where I live and can't even get health insurance in this state. I have nothing tying me down here. 

I could get a job to save up money for a few months and get a car, and then once I had enough, just take off.

Go somewhere, anywhere, where I feel like I have a chance.

I always daydreamed about living in a place I loved, with a group of friends who were like family, and a significant other who was my partner-in-crime.

But I'm just lonely. Miserable and lonely. 

Part of me finds the vagabond lifestyle appealing. Get a big ol' van and drive around, seeing new sights, exploring what's around you, no true destination.

But the only thing that turns me off from it is that vagabonds don't have a home to go back to.

I want that. A home base. Somewhere to return that gives me warm feelings and is comfortable.

It's been a long time since that feeling. Since I was a child.

I'm 25. I think about death. I want to just pack my few belongings and move somewhere and see if I can find where I belong. Where I'd be welcomed and think, ""This is where I was meant to be"". See people who greet me with open arms and love.

Or maybe, maybe I will never find that feeling.

I am a 22 year old female 4 months post partum and within 10 lbs (slightly overweight) of my ideal weight for my height and about to start seeking mental health help. I have done more than enough research to know I do not wish to be on an SSRI(talking to people who have taken them, and internet) as I do not wish to gain weight (I'm trying to lose it) and at 22, who wants to lose their sex drive?

I could really use some advice, folks. Am I allowed to ask for a specific drug to be put on? (According to research wellbutrin is the one ideally I would like to be on).

I'm in no way drug seeking and if my therapy can go without drugs, then that would be amazing, but I fear that will not be the case. 

If wellbutrin does not work out for me, does anyone know of another drug that is not an SSRI that would be viable for me? I'm willing to live with all side effects EXCEPT weight gain and loss of libido.

The first place you went always sent you somewhere else, and it was usually the wrong place, but that second place would send you to the the right place (or at least right enough).

Finding the right therapist or therapy has always seemed to work the same way, for me at least.  You get it wrong a couple of times, but you learn enough to find what's right.

So, back to my uni story, I eventually learned to not even bother trying to figure out what the right place was.  I would just pick a department/office that was at least somehow related to what I wanted to do, and start there.  As I would say, I was getting the first building out of the way.

So, don't agonize too much over your choices.  Always remember that if a therapy or therapist doesn't work out, you wil--if nothing else--be able to get guidance toward someone or something better.  

Besides, it took you 25 years to become who you are.  You aren't going to change overnight.  You are starting a process.  Be patient with the process, and be patient with yourself.

Be aware there will be a good amount of rambling and I understand if you don't want to take the time to read it.  I know if I saw this long a post I would immediately avoid it.  This is mostly just me wanting to vent somewhere that I won't be ridiculed or belittled for my issues.  Please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes which I will attempt to avoid.  This is the most effort I have put into something in a long time, which can tell you how easy my life is.  I really have no logical reason for feeling this bad have a relatively well paying job and it is not very difficult to do just very stressful.  I do nothing outside of work that requires any effort.

I have had diagnosed depression since I was about 17 and it has been dragging on for years.  To start I come from a long line of people with severe depression and/or bipolar disorder.  My father has had some battles with bipolar but has been relatively fine.  In my fathers family there have been multiple submissions to mental institutions and hospital for depressive state.  One of his brothers recently took his own life.  On my mothers side both my mother and her mother suffered severe depression and are heavily medicated for it.  A cousin on my mothers side has been hospitalized and sent to jail after some violent issues stemming from bipolar disorder.

My relationship with my family has always been great.  My parents were never physically abusive and I generally only received punishment when it was due.  I love both of my parents unconditionally and what I am saying going forward is just my own feelings.  My mother is an obsessive compulsive clean freak.  Everything in the house had to be in neat order and white glove clean.  I have always had an issue with both organization and cleanliness and am extremely lazy so we generally clashed about keeping my room clean and doing chores around the house.  The only problem I had with my dad is that he would generally side with my mom even when her arguments were irrational.

School had never been a major problem because I retained information well and performed well on tests.  The biggest issue was my extreme distaste for doing homework.  The only time I would do my schoolwork was at school in the 15 minutes before the day officially started and the short breaks between classes.  Because of this most of the homework was sub par or incomplete, and that lowered my grades.  My parents thought that me not wanting to do my homework was caused by ADD so they brought me in for testing.  The tests were inconclusive but we still decided to try medication.  This is were things took a turn for the worst.  Instead of helping me important on important things like school, homework, and my job it caused me to focus completely on my depression which had been somewhat light until this time.  I soon was unable to even sit in class without breaking down and crying.  Most of my time at school was spent in the nurse/counselors office sobbing.   Soon I had to start going home from school early because I could no longer stay in class.  I ended up having to quit my job because I couldn't stand being there.  All I could do was sit at home and lay on my floor or my bed and just stare blankly at whatever was in front of me unable to even move.  Once this started I soon went off the ADD medication.

I then started seeing a psychiatrist.  They started medicating me.  I went through so many different medication changes generally getting worse each time.  School life had been steadily declining and I was soon unable to even go to school.  My teachers, principal, and guidance counselor were all very supportive and they approved me just stop going to school and my current grades would be my final grade.  Yet still the depression just continued to cripple me.  Eventually I found a medication that helped somewhat and slightly lessened the depression, but it was still there.  I was still unable to work and spent most of my time alone either reading, watching TV, playing video games or just staring at the wall crying and in fetal position and this continued for some time.  

Fast forward to the end of summer I am off to a local community college.  I had to move out of my parents because I could not stand living under their control.  I moved into an apartment complex near the community college, and enrolled in a few classes.  I did have a roommate and he was a generally nice guy and we got along really well.  This is were my extreme apathy and laziness set in and my roommate was of the same volition.  The apartment was a complete pigsty garbage all over the floor, the tabletops, the counter tops, and in large piles in the corners of the rooms.  My room was just as bad if not worse than the main living quarters and would have to wade through piles of clothes and trash to get to my bed.  My roommate was just as bad if not worse than me having just as much crap all over the floor/bed of his room.  At first my parents tried to visit every so often but my place was so unkempt they could no longer do so.  Eventually they started to try and control me having weekly inspections of my room making sure it was at least somewhat clean and well kept.  They were paying for the apartment so they had the right to tell me what to do.  Th reason they were paying for the apartment is because I was paying for school through various scholarships I had won, mostly due to my father basically writing my essays for me.  The problem was I had tried to go to classes but I was still unable to properly sit pay attention, do homework, and even stay in class.  Eventually I just stopped going.  Nearing the end of the first semester I was in a panic because I had completely avoided classes and was doomed to fail so I had to fess up to my parents.  

I have never been directly suicidal.  I know I could never take my own life, but the problem is most of the time I have no desire to continue living.  I told my parents this at the same time I told them I was no longer going to school and I was sent to the hospital and put on suicide watch.  All that happened in the hospital was I got on some different medication and basically did nothing for a couple of days except for read.  They eventually released me and I went to live with my parents.  At this time I told them that I appreciated everything that they had done for me, but wanted them to basically stay out of my life and not tell me how to live it.  They accepted this and we still stayed in contact and have had a good relationship but I know it is extremely hard for them to just sit aside and do nothing.

I tried going to school once again but it went pretty much the same way.  I ended up switching jobs from a pretty nice retail job selling computers because I was getting shit for hours and needed money because my parents were no longer paying my rent.  So I went back to my job from high school working at a fast food burger joint.  At this time I was a full time employee on the overnight shift working with two other people whose lives were going nowhere.  One a college dropout and the other a mentally challenged individual who was the nephew of the manager.  The job was relatively easy but I had to do a lot of shitty, dirty work and deal with assholes who would come and get food.  Most of the people coming in were not bad people and I had no reason to hate them, but when I saw them walk into the door or hear the shrill beep on the headset notifying me someone was at the drive through I felt nothing but utter contempt.  Ultimately I stopped working the night shift because I had become unreliable due to sickness and my depression causing me to leave work.  They put me on a normal shift and stuck me in the back drive through forced to be alone doing nothing but taking orders/money and doing dishes.  I fucking hated doing dishes and the ones at this place were caked in grease and nasty as fuck.  The only way to get the dishes clean was via a giant high pressure hose that would power clean the grease and cover me in water in the process so during the winter I would freeze my ass off through the drive through window while taking money.  

Now that I was normal shift and working drive through I was getting worse.  Often I would go into the freezer and just scream, or go to the back and slash and tear apart boxes.  Soon it was difficult for me to even stay at work.  My bills were piling up because I got shit for pay and less hours because of how unreliable I had become and I would frivolously spend money on useless shit, plus bills, food, and gas to get to my job I had pretty much no money and was relying on payday loans.  I received a speeding ticket because I was late for work and was caught going 90 in a 70 zone.  I couldn't afford the $200 dollar ticket and was forced to go to my parents.  They gladly helped and payed for the ticket and loaned me money to pay my bills, but I was still very distant and almost unappreciative of how much they were helping me.

During this time frame I had moved into another apartment near the same community college with 2 new roommates.  One of the roommates had a girlfriend and she lived there because she had nowhere else to go.  I got along with them very well and we had a lot of the same interests.  The other roommate was a completely different kind of person.  The jockey douche bag type that is always working out drinking and trying to fuck random chicks.  He soon moved out probably because he couldn't stand living with us because we were all lazy slobs who acted the same way and he wasn't like that.  He was actually not a bad guy and was nice to me and left with no grudges.  The other roommates girlfriend took the other room of the apartment so we had an extra room to store shit.  They brought in a cat, which I dealt with even though I fucking hated that thing.  It annoyed me always meowing and scratching shit up and destroying blinds.  Eventually it died they were sad and I was glad it was gone even though I never really told them.  By this time they had figured out that she was pregnant and that it probably happened either just before or just after they had moved in.  By the end of the year I was living with a baby.  The funny thing is that the baby was less annoying than the fucking cat and I didn’t really have any issues with it. 

With help from my and further medication I began applying for new jobs and was quickly hired by a tech company to provide phone sales and support regarding their products.  It is a well paying job with great benefits, and overall the job is easy enough.  I can quite easily fix peoples issues because I retain information well and am good at using my resources.  The problem is this world isn't about helping people with their problems it is about getting money from them and I have to try to sell them something so I can hit a minimum metric to keep my job.  The job environment itself is mixed good and bad.  My coworkers are good people and my boss is great and extremely understanding of my depression situation.  I have even worked out with my employer being able to leave early some days yet retain my job.  The issue is I am getting to the point where I can't handle it either.  The constant drive for selling, and the customers who are complete idiots when it comes to the products and services they are using through us.  I am forced to not only deal with pissed off stupid people trying to fix shit either they broke through ignorance, or fix shit that is just broken because of problems with my employers systems.  I also have to try to sell them something.  As long as I am able to fix their issues most people are willing to at least throw me a bone and buy something cheap, but it isn't enough to meet the demands of my job.  So I have to forsake my morals and just try to sell them shit for sometimes overprice and sometimes just a shitty product that barely works and we can provide almost no support with.  My work justifies it as helping with their needs as individuals and businesses by fitting them with products that will help them.  A lot of the times they already own what they need and unless they are willing to renew the service I have to try to sell them I do not believe they truly need and I know they have no desire to talk about, let alone purchase.

I also have to deal with a ridiculous bureaucracy having to follow rules and procedures that are somewhat pointless and I have no say in them.  I am on the lowest part of the totem pole so I have a boss, a bosses boss, a bosses bosses boss, etc, etc.  They keep changing rules that make it harder to stay employed all based around selling.  I have been able to scrape by through sheer luck, and just having the knowledge of how our products and our systems work.  I also have been fortunate enough to have lenience regarding my depression and I believe that is part of what keeps me employed.

I have moved into another apartment where I live by myself and still have no organization or cleanliness to it.  My parents are not even allowed to come to my place because of how bad it is.  They still care for me and have been helpful in my depression.  Yet I still feel like a black hole is sucking all of the happiness out of me replacing it with laziness, self-loathing, major depression, and anxiety.  I feel like I am reaching the end of the rope when it comes to my job and fear for what will happen if I lose it.

I have a good amount of friends but most of them live multiple hours away and only come home for short visits.  I have one friend I hang out with every weekend and I am grateful he does so even though I can't understand why anyone would want to hang out with me.  I probably have great qualities and am a good friend, but I still don't feel that way about myself and can't comprehend how anyone can.

I have never been with a girl not sex, not kissing, not anything.  I have no problems talking to girls but don't have the self confidence to do anything.  I feel if I can't like or love me how could anyone else and I should not bother them with my problems.  I do almost nothing social and spend all of my time at work or at home doing nothing.

I can't help but feel guilty for how depressed I am and how much it is affecting other people.  My boss at work has been extremely understanding and supportive through the entire ordeal but I know believe my issues may be affecting him and other members of my team even though it probably isn’t.  I feel horrible that I leave my parents in the dark about this mostly because I can't express my feelings properly and don't want to burden them with my problems, even though they are more than willing to listen and support me.

At this point I am just wanting to get this off my chest and really don't feel like posting it anywhere that anybody who knows me would pay attention to.  I felt the people here would be most the understanding and least judgmental.  If no one reads it I will be OK but if people do I also feel fine because I can't think of anyone I know who will read this and even if they do they probably wouldn't link it to me because I wear a good happy mask and most of the time can keep my emotions in check while in public.

We'll call him ""Dan"". He and I are both a year out. We live in the same neighborhood. Dan and I have been friends since sophomore year, when we started as roommates. I have since neglected to live with him (living with him is a challenge), but we've remained good friends.

In general Dan is a socialble individual. He makes friends well, does well with women, and always knows how to tell a story and make a mood jovial. He drinks and does a lot of weed. And those who know him better will tell you that he's clearly covering up a lot. He can sometimes be quick to anger, and in general has a knack for reinventing history and realigning his understanding of past events to satisfy him better (for instance, he and I had a brief falling out which a few months later he flat out denied ever really occurred to someone who was very much a first hand-observer of many of the outbursts our falling out led to).

Dan has had ""episodes"" as of late, where he suddenly finds himself in an intense depression. He usually calls me, and tells me to come over and meet him. I'll describe the episodes below:

1) senior year of college. At this point, he's been about a year or so out of a long term relationship that went back to high school. He started having a few dates and hook-ups with this one girl. It ended up not working out and it just brought a lot of things up with him. He started to feel like a waste, and like he didn't know what he was doing. I walked around with him, we smoked a couple cigarettes, talked it out. Eventually he thanked me for our friendship and said that our friendship kept him alive multiple times, implying there may have been moments since we've known each other where he contemplated suicide (he made an attempt on his own life at age 16, pills, failed, thankfully).

2)About a year has elapsed since graduation. He's not in a relationship at the moment IIRC. He calls me to his place where he starts to go off on how he feels his life has been a waste since graduation, and how he's made absolutely no progress (at this point neither he nor myself has a steady job of any sort. I dont have financial worries, but he frequently has to borrow from his family so that may factor into the situation). He also makes reference to his attempted suicide and a couple times states wishing he were dead. I talk him through it, and through positive language am able to make him understand that its normal to feel lost out of school and that we all need to take life at our own pace. After lots of back and forth, he starts to get positive again and we brainstorm ideas for projects to work on down the line (we dabble in art). As we have our talk, I tell him I think he should get therapy. He at first agrees and says he'll work out a plan with his parents to pay for it, but then later backs out, since he feels fine. I believe that he looks better off so I leave him to it.

3)Last night: He slept through an important work obligation, drunk. It threw him into a violent depression. He called me to come over. His apartment was a mess. His knuckles bloody from punching a door. I tried to get him to sit, but he insisted we leave. When we walked around the neighborhood he kicked trash waiting to be collected and threw his cigarettes to the curb, occasionally yelling. I had to struggle to keep him from waking neighbors. He was laying heavily into himself and myself for not accomplishing anything, being a deadbeat, borrowing from his parents. Lots more of wishing he were dead, and wishing he'd killed himself. Like a LOT more. And many more references to his previous suicide attempt. I got him back to my place, got a bandage on him, and we talked a little more. I almost convinced him to crash at my place, but he finally insisted that he be able to leave so he could call his girlfriend to apologize (they had a row earlier over the phone), and then go to sleep. Before he left my place he was insanely apologetic, calling himself a bad friend (much as I wanted to agree with him I kept telling him it was okay) but still rude and snappy. I got a text from him just now saying hed spoken to his girlfriend (lets call her Donna) and he wished me good night.

Now, clearly, the situation is escalating. He's becoming more pronounced in his depression. This is not just something I can talk him through anymore (I could barely keep him focused last night). Clearly I can't let him resume the same pattern of ""acting like everything's ok"". So I was hoping tomorrow to deliver him an ultimatum, that he either calls his parents and explains he needs to get therapy, or I speak to a therapist about what has transpired and compel them to intervene (provided they believe what I've witnessed is enough to call him a potential suicide risk).

I hate taking force but I feel as if there's no way I can just sit back and wait for something to happen. He's clearly not able to help himself out of it. Is the plan of action I described above sufficient? Should I back off? Should I move directly to appealing for an intervention from a third party?

EDIT: tl;dr Friend is displaying depressive tendencies, including wishes of death. Has done so in the past but then ""gotten over it"". Episodes escalating in intensity and nature. What sort of action can/should I take?

EDIT2: Update: A friend of mine whom I've kept aware of the story, made the intriguing suggestion of changing the ultimatum. Instead the conditions would be that he either get help, through his family or otherwise, or else I simply wash my hands of association with him. I feel that he feels that so long as I'm around to be there if he loses it, he won't take the notion that he needs help seriously. I am confident he'll attempt to deflect and make the event not seem so serious. So perhaps it just needs to be that he either seeks help or I won't be involved in any way.  Thoughts on this?

EDIT3: A miraculous thing kind of occurred.  Dan called me last night to apologize and also to tell me that the undergoing was a wake up call for him.  He's making changes to his life now and is planning to arrange a way to get therapy.  I am relieved beyond words.  Thanks for your input!

Let me start off by saying I've taken mental illness drugs before and it was the worst decision of my life.  They permanently ruined a part of my brain and after more than a decade after taking them I still feel ""broke"". I'm fine that's besides the point of this post I just want to get that out there so you all understand my pov. Also please keep in mind I don't fully understand because I'm not her,  so if I play something down it's unintentional, assume the worst (reasonably).  

My wife is working 50 hrs a week (required by her job) she has a well (enough) paying job with amazing benefits that's extremely hard to leave. But it has an awful boss. She's going to school full time for social work,  she's doing great in both places (if you ask me). 

Lately things have been getting heavy at her work.  Lots of pressure and shitty people. Then she recently got an A- and is absolutely devastated that she missed out on a 4.0. She tends to set impossible goals for herself which she sometimes achieves,  sometimes not. But it's devastating when she doesn't.  She's a hardcore, professional worrier and over achiever. Seriously it's nearly impossible for her to complete anything that is reasonably close to the minimum requirement. And these recent events and added pressures are getting the better of her.

I'm really laid back and tend to go with the flow and I'm able to be happy with my work even when I fail.  I tried explaining that but she can't understand it. 

She wants a Dr. To prescribe anti-depressants as it's the only fix that doesn't require a ton of time (which she doesn't have much of). I've always felt that the easy way to fix something is usually the wrong way and on top of me having a bad history with psychoactive medication I want to recommend the route of CBT and the like.

So I'm going to leave this open ended abs just let you guys tell me what's up.  How can I help her do what's best?

The person who gives you these awful feelings of panic does not mean to, but it is a sign that you are not meant to stay. You will accept what has happened and new things will start to fly at you from all directions, there to help you. It's not wise to stick in the past, but yet dive into the future to continue on.

For the most part I'm a lurker on Reddit minus a few posts on mmo subs and a few other topics. I've been wanting to post in depression for awhile, but it's taken me some time to really come to terms with where I am in my life. I know I have depression and a hell of a case of social anxiety, have probably been dealing with it for over a decade now.

I apologize for being selfish here and ranting. I feel like i have to get this out there.

I'm thirty years old, and about a year ago I was informed I was going to be laid off from my relatively mindless data entry job at an insurance company. They were kind and granted us about 14 months of notice. They were also cruel, and gave us 14 months of notice. I've had way too much time to think.

 If i had been smart, i would have used this time to improve my situation. I live paycheck to paycheck. When i started this job five years ago, i was 250 lbs. Ive put on over 100 extra pounds since this desk job, i've had less energy, I spend most of my free time at home at my computer lurking on reddit or jumping from game to game because nothing satisfies me.

And now I'm a month away from my termination date.

I know deep down that I have worth as a human being. I used to not even have that. Some days on long drives I'd contemplate driving my car into oncoming traffic. I'd avoid the simplest social interactions because...i dont know why. I still really dont know why, and i've grown accustomed to accept this too. Its hard enough to understand that I crave solitude, how do you explain to your incredibly supportive friends that you dont want to deal with them? I leave the phone unanswered nine times out of ten so i dont have to explain.

So now the end of what was a reasonably comfortable life is wrapping up, and honestly I feel like this could be the beginning of a new chapter. I dont have a college degree so i might be limited in the choices i have in terms of new employment, but i have a very generous severance package to look forward to. In many ways I have an opportunity to take the time i need to seize control of my life.

If i wasnt terrified of pissing it all away, that is.

I'm not posting this to garner sympathy, just to open up for those who I know are in the same kind of boat. There's so much opportunity out there and it's hard to see when you're so deeply entrenched in old patterns. I'm trying to view my situation as forced change, as a sign to make a new path towards an improved life that i can be proud of. I may try taking up writing again, i know getting into better shape would benefit me greatly. I'm going to try posting here more frequently, both to offer support to others and also try to work through my own issues.

Every day is a challenge to not give up. But I think together, we can all overcome the weight of this bizarre life and find a better place to be emotionally. It doesnt have to be so hard, does it?

I haven't been referred to one yet by my insurance,however, Monday I will be contacting them for a referral. But my problems have gone beyond my control....dropping out of school, thousands of dollars in debt...I just don't want to have a therapist that is a dick. I know it sounds stupid, but if I'm going to pour all my deepest thoughts out to someone, I want them to be understanding, empathic, and really genuinely passionate about their work. 

I've suffered from depression since high school. First, it just started with anxiety as a young child which then led to worse anxiety and then when high school hit, mild depression combined with moderate anxiety. Now that I'm in the first year of college (well, WAS), my anxiety is pretty bad and my depression might even be worse. I am empty. I feel nothing. I have no hope to live. I don't fear death; only painful death. If the world were to end tomorrow, I'd grab a drink and make a toast. Sometimes, I don't cry at all...I just sit there, staring at nothing. Other times, I sit there and bawl like a baby...about how pathetic I am and how much of a failure I am.

On the outside, I appear to be a normal girl. I can admit I am attractive and intelligent. Then I can also admit that I'm not that attractive by any means, and I make the worst decisions in the world: I'm lazy, pathetic, and good for nothing. On the inside, I feel broken.

My mother also suffers from depression. She has manic depression and a load of health issues such as thyroid problems, low calcium and anemia, and other shit. Combined with a VERY short temper and intolerance, you get a mother who use to beat me with a clothes hanger at night because I wasn't able to fall asleep. So she beat me to sleep and I cried myself to sleep. She would avoid my face and mainly aim for arms/legs so teachers wouldn't see. In all honesty, I don't think she meant to hurt me but her anger was uncontrollable...my dad, the nicest man ever, did nothing but watch...he tried to protect me at times but my mother's anger paralleled to none other. She's better now, but being beat with metal clothes hangers/thick sticks/belts as a child for honestly, no reason sometimes kind of fucked me up. 

I also kinda want meds. Is that bad? My friend takes meds for her anxiety/depression and she says she feels like for once, the world is okay and she isn't freaking out about everything. She describes either a tranquil, light feeling or an over-active, jumpy emotion: either way, they both sound better to me than what I feel: emptiness, regret, remorse, bitterness, self-hate, and failure.

I spend hours and hours studying and I look at other people and wonder how the fuck they can do it. How? What about them is so incredibly different that they are capable of understanding this? Put a project in front of me that other people can do with few problems and I fucking crack under the pressure.

At this point the only reasonable conclusion that I can come to is that I am simply too stupid to do this. Or anything else I enjoy doing. I like to play music, but I'm terrible at it. I constantly make mistakes and get to the point where I just wanted to throw my stupid fucking guitar through the fucking wall. I enjoy sim racing, but I'm no good at that either. I can't be consistent at all and I crash on every fucking lap no matter what controller I use. By the time I make it 5 minutes in I want to put my head under a fucking tank track.

I can't even keep a shitty job in tech support because apparently I'm too fucking stupid to just answer a goddamn phone and talk to someone about something I should know about after two fucking years.

What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I incapable of doing even the most ridiculously simple of things? I can practice for hundreds of hours and still be no better than your average beginner with a few hours of experience.

I would think, what's the point of living, I don't know if I'm happy and what will I do in life.

Then realized, I was barely 20, and I could live up to maybe 80-100.
Even though, parents have restricted me on a lot of things, made my life like a hell, I have came through.

I used to just sit on roof of my house and think for hours on hours, before parents telling me to study.

I got into college near my house, and I had to always work and help my parents out.
Never really could participate in school stuff that much earlier on in college.
With dedication and constituency, I have managed to get 3.9 gpa and get into Johns Hopkins.
While I did all these to take care of my family, myself, and my friends, I mostly did it just for me.
I want to do something with my life.

I have Asian parents so they were pretty damn strict and looking back, I'm glad I didn't give up.
There's going to be times in life where you just want to because you don't know what to do, I've had plenty of that.

Start with getting some help, therapy, talk to a friend- communicate effectively and tell someone.
Just let it out, don't hold on to your feelings.


You can try by going to gym, go out with friends, just live for yourself and others. Don't think about small things, how one drink ruined.
You are just feeding off of negative energy.

Relax, try mediating, it helped my mood and focus greatly. 
Take up a new hobby, you can meet new friends and enjoy yourself to it.

Whatever it comes down to, you'll be fine.
Hang in there.

I was resitant about joining a community for those with depression because I've always wanted to keep quiet about the issue, never wanted to identify with it or get attention from it. Well, today, I accept that I need a crutch and this is just me calling out and asking for that crutch, please.

I may make a throwaway account in the future depending on how personal these posts get, but right now I'd prefer to stick to my main account because my history here does an accurate job at painting my life story. 

So hi, I'm Emily. I guess I've just committed to being an active member of this community. I'd like to just talk about what's on my mind and I invite anyone who feels like they need someone to reach out to me in return.

So, I was on 20mg of prozac a day while in the hospital and I've been taking the same dosage while out. My first full day in the hospital, I went emotionally numb. I couldn't cry, feel anger, feel anxiety, feel depression, feel sad, nothing. I talked to every therapist about all my problems as if we were talking about the weather. I even smiled, laughed, and made puns. This is NOT normal. I am normally an extremely anxious, emotional person.

I was released from the hospital after five days of suicide watch. I hadn't self-harmed while in the ward because, like I previously mentioned, I don't wish to draw attention to myself. The nurses saw me as a happy, young woman and they allowed me to go home.

I suspected that my emotions would return. That I would feel joy to see my cats again. Hell, I'm normally a person who daydreams about people she loves dying, imagines their funerals, and ends up crying from the mere thought in public. But even if I tried to MAKE myself feel something, I could not. I couldn't even feel compassion for the other patients in the ward when they told me their stories, and I'm normally a very empathetic, caring person.

Things that used to evoke extreme stress or panic within me no longer cause any form of reaction at all. I'm emotionally dead, and I have been even before I started medication on my first morning in the hospital.

My therapist says it's likely that I'm going through a trauma, because I can still react in thoughts, but I can't feel the emotions that would correspond to those thoughts. She says it's likely that my emotions will come back soon, but this emptiness is so big and I see myself as so, so small, just a pawn being pushed around by doctors throughout this whole process. I've hit rock bottom before, but even then I was able to cry. I've never been through anything like this. I guess I'm scared, even if I technically feel no fear. Can anyone relate?

Also, my prozac hasn't lifted my urge for pain/death, though I can assure everyone I am no longer planning to commit suicide. All the medication has done for me so far is give me a strange form of insomnia and it's draining.

Long story short, I had this great fear of dying everytime I showed small symptoms of a major disease (such as cancer). This could be due to the fact that 2 people I knew died this year and I feared that I could’ve been next.  I am grateful that this problem is somewhat over, though it could come back later on.

Now, I have to deal with the real issues. What’s making me depressed and anxious is my future. This is due to my mediocre grades.
I am a 22 year-old university student studying accounting at an average-ranked university in Canada. After a bachelor’s degree, most accounting graduates strive for a designation called the CPA. To get into the CPA school, applicants must get a global GPA of 3 (though the average GPA of selected candidates is a 3.4),  and they must get at least B- in many courses throughout their degrees, which includes very difficult classes. 

So far, I am halfway done in my program. My GPA is a 3.04, but I did not get a B- in  a few of   the required . In addition, I do have a failure on my transcript, and might get a second one after my exam on Monday. 
I am currently enrolled in a summer class. The class is about Canadian taxes, and it is required for me to get a B-. I did do this class in the Winter term, but I dropped it halfway through the semester because I had developed bad anxiety and it was to much for me to bare. I am heading into this exam with a 53% average and the final exam is worth 55%;  I’m really not prepared. 

To make matters worse, classes are only going to be harder and my GPA is going to go down drastically. I am really worried about my future and I’m depressed these days. I don’t have much job experience, my parents  pay for my tuition and they don’t know about my bad grades, and I feel really bad that they are wasting money for me. Furthermore, although my dad is in one of these highest tax brackets (my mom doesn’t work), he often complains about money nowadays. He recently  borrowed $6,000 from my sister who works as a part-time teller. My parents often pressure me to do an internship but given my very little job experience and a few bad grades in accounting classes, I doubt anybody will take me. 

How do I turn my life around? What can I do to relieve this sadness and hopefully get into a CPA program?

After senior year, I moved 60 miles away to live with my dad because I had a job lined up. During this time, I had no friends outside of work. I occasionally went home to hang with friends but most of time was spent alone. I went off to college at the end of the summer. My freshman year of college consisted of talking on the phone to a long distance girlfriend (not the friend discussed before) and hanging with my roommate who was in the same boat as me. I had no friends and my studies suffered. The only reason I passed my classes and I am not trying to brag here, but I can BS tests well. my girlfriend broke up with me at the beginning of the summer. I spent that summer doing a hole lot of nothing at my mom's house. a few friends from high school hung out with me, but they had changed. or maybe I had changed. I don't know. at this time, I was falling further into depression, with it hitting me daily. At the beginning of the next school year, I found out that the best friend that I spent that summer with earlier moved to the city where I was going to college. We started hanging out and found the same connection we had before. We decided to push it further and started dating. during this time I began to rise out of depression a little bit. I still had a lot of trouble making friend but I began to meet people and make some friends. At the end of that school year. We moved in together (mostly out of necessity). I was so afraid of ruining things our relationship that I began to ruin it. I smothered her and we ended up breaking up for a short while. during that time, I was very depressed but didn't show it to her. We got back together and things were better. four months later she decided to join the army. We decided to get married before she left (it was probably too soon). Our wedding and the time leading up to was amazing. The excitement held back most of my depression. It was great. A week after we married, she left for basic training. we mailed each other a lot and those letters kept me alive. While she was gone, my depression spiraled. She was there for 4 months, she came home on medical. when She got back and I had become a complete loner. She was disappointed with what I had done while she was gone. I was able to feign confidence and motivation after she got back. We were having having talks about twice a month on how I wasn't getting better. She really didn't understand. I was so afraid to bring up my depression to her that I made up excuses and tried to fix those even though they weren't the problem. Well, that summer ended and I went back to class (the current semester). We continued having those talks and our intimacy slowly faded away. I love her so damn much. Well, last week she ended it with me. we are still living together. mostly because she feels sorry for me and knows I cant afford this place on my own. About an hour after she ended it, I drove away and went camping in the snow for the weekend. I turned off my phone for the weekend. When I got back, there was a missing person report for me. This past weekend, I officiated her dads wedding. ( we did not want to ruin their special day, they are very sweet)  With each night that passes since she ended it I fall deeper into depression. I have cried   more than I have in the past 15 years. I cant concentrate, I cant make decisions, I cant sleep, I have no motivation, I cant do anything. I have a test and quiz tomorrow, I cant bring myself to even think about them. Finals are coming up and that is stressing me up. My car got towed because I couldn't get it to start, I have to pay to get it back, and then buy a new battery and replace the rear suspension. This semester has been my hardest ever, and somehow I am doing well but it is driving me deeper into depression. I want to curl up and die. I spend my days zoning out. I am not the person I want to be. I have had this dream of being that perfect father and husband. I want to want to do things with my kids instead of sit at home all day. I want to be excited to get home each day. I am none of this but I want to be. The problem is that I cant find the motivation due to my depression. and that is stressing me out even more. If I cant be the person I want to be, how can I do anything? I wish I could go crash my car and forget the last year of my life. I have considered it. I am in a pit, I think the only thing keeping me alive is the thought of how sad it would make my mom. (she is also very depressed and suicidal). I don't know what to do. I cant stand life right now. dammit. I hate myself. I dont know what I want, no one knows this. and my now ex-wife wont talk to me because she felt that I never listened to her during those monthly talks. I did, but I always focused on the wrong part and always failed. she seems to want to care, but from a distance. sorry if this is too long.

TL;DR I have been depressed for a while, it caused my wife to leave me, and now I am suicidal and lack all purpose.",,0.0,,2013-12-09 07:00:48,,,0,False,,,,0,,cdx9eme,,,,,t3_1sg0u2,,,t1_cdx9eme,,,,t3_1sg0u2,,,,,,,,1428330046.0,,0,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,0,,

I've been dealing with my depression for 7 years now and lost my job about 6 months ago because I had a major episode. I've been taking the time since then to try a new form of medication and work on my writing while looking for a job. Part of the reason I lost my job was my own fault (for trying to keep working while going through an episode without explaining this to my manager or the client) and part of the reason was because my managers apparently have no understanding of depression and associated it with feeling sad.

Anyway, today's been another great day - lost my medication somehow and wound up having to go to the pharmacy and get a repeat while feeling like I was going crazy. When I got home, I felt compelled to write down a short story to try and describe to other people kind of what it's like dealing with day-to-day depression.

-----

Looking up from her monitor, Lucy found herself staring over the top of work-buried heads, across the office, to the tank of tropical fish that had been installed by a previous owner and left by the current owner of the building. Half-a-dozen tropical fish swam languorously in circles, tails flapping lazily in the simulated currents of the tank. Lucy was struck with a sense of sadness that took her entirely by surprise. Prior to this point, though she had looked at the tank several times every day while walking backwards and forwards from the office laser-jet, she'd never taken a moment to actually notice the tank.

She had no idea who fed the fish. Did the tank clean itself or was someone coming in after hours to do that? She had no idea how many fish were meant to be in the tank, couldn't remember their colours, shapes… How terrible to be a fish in a tank.

All day, every day (and night?) spent swimming around in circles, no escape from the limited confines, no conversation or change, nothing to do. Lucy could feel herself staring over the edge of a pit so black and deep that to even glance at it was enough to be lost, so she turned back to the monitor screen and tried to focus on her work, although the blue wash of light from the monitor was hurting her eyes.

Kevin stared through the window of the pet store and watched a hamster run in circles in a little plastic wheel, legs flying frantically to keep pace with its stumpy body. Any slower and it was in danger of falling over, its own enthusiastic pace growing faster and faster as it continually sped to the finish line of a race it could not possibly win.

Kevin had stopped by the window on a dark, blustery evening, with the vague notion of buying a pet. Probably a cat. You couldn't have dogs in his apartment, and he didn't like rats. But something about the hamster's struggle to avoid getting trapped in a vicious circle was keeping him rooted to the spot like watching a car speeding towards a pedestrian.

He knew he didn't really need a cat, couldn't really afford one, didn't really want the hassle of taking care of one. But he was lonely, and his social life seemed to consist of going to work and then going out drinking with people he wasn't even really sure he actually liked at all; so it would be nice to just have the one being who actually just liked being in his presence without pretence.

Annie lifted the glass to her mouth and washed down her pills, feeling nothing. It was hard to say if the lack of feeling was caused by the pills or not. It was also very hard to care. Hard to remember how long she'd been taking the pills. Hard to remember what it was like without them.

The sun shone through the window across the table before her; harsh, yellow light burning warmth into her fingers and wrists, distracting or detracting from the itch of her sleeves on her arms. Outside the world continued to turn as she sat and pondered her coffee. A blackbird (or thrush?) suddenly dropped into the garden.

It glanced sideways at her, neither inquisitive nor frightened, merely noting her position in much the same way she noted it. It hopped forward seven leaps and proceeded to make a mess. It tossed leaves, bark, twigs and dirt to either side, digging without rhyme or reason in the garden.

After two minutes of this, it stopped, looked again at Annie, then flew away. Annie sipped her coffee and probed at the recesses of her mind—like she was probing at a dentist-numbed tooth, pressing and exploring about for a reaction. It wasn't that the bird was significant—“birds are not significant,” she would be sure to write in her journal—but its appearance was likely going to be the only thing to happen today that wasn't part of her usual routine. Was there a metaphor here? No, it was a bird. Birds are not metaphors.

She felt compelled to write something, to grip on to some aspect of the moment and spin it into something beautiful or frightening or sad or all of the emotions at the same time but all she felt was the late morning light on her hands and wrists and arms.

So she drank her coffee and tried her best to feel sad about it.

Two further notes:

1. Yeah, the story doesn't lead anywhere. Neither does my experience with depression. It just kind of goes on like this - although I guess it's not all bad? Not all the time anyway. I could have written about having a severe episode but I honestly don't know that I can just at the moment. Quite apart from anything else, severe episodes are intensely personal and different for everyone. If you want to read about that sort of thing maybe try David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* which has a pretty good description of what it's like.

2. I write all kinds of stuff. I put them on my blog.

131213,,False,Absent_as_Always,,,,"I see. I ask because it's one thing to treat situational depression, but it's a whole other demon trying to tackle depression with no apparent cause. If it's due to your situation, then you can fix that and hopefully lift the burden of depression from over you. The latter however would be very difficult to treat without medication, or at the very least consulting a therapist. Either way though, seeing a therapist would be ideal of course. (this is my perspective, take that as you will)

Well, then you are aware of that fact that you should find a new job, and you're also aware of the fact that your anxiety is what's holding you back from finding another one. That's an important first step, self-awareness. I know how you feel, honestly, about feeling powerless as a job prospect. But at the very least it couldn't hurt to apply? That's not to say you should up and quit your current job tomorrow, but you and i both know finding something better is a key factor in your overall well being. Maybe if you find a better job for you, you might gain some empowerment necessary to pull the rest of your life together? If you don't mind me asking, whats your current job? What career do you want? There has got to be a way to find something to make you happy.

Moving on to your boyfriend, in my opinion you should tell him what you just told me. Granted he's not already aware of the situation, the part about your depression being the cause of you pushing him away. From what i gather of the situation, which admittedly is very little, you pushed him away originally and now that you're ready to take him back he's no longer willing. Maybe he took that original abandonment you showed him as disdain, and is a little bitter over the situation? If having a discussion with him hasn't or isn't working, you might have to accept the fact that it's time to move on. Or try counseling, if you're both comfortable and willing enough to make it work. I don't know much, but i do know that nothing good is going to come from leaving the environment as it is currently. Also, i don't know your boyfriend personally, but has he made any attempt to comfort you during that time? Or even attempt to find out whats wrong? There's a few possible reasons why he wouldn't. but that's here nor there.

And lastly, about the therapist, ultimately that's your decision. I completely understand your hesitation to tell your parents, I've been trying to find the courage to do that myself. Only you can decide if it's worth it. Would the benefits of therapy outweigh the flack you'd receive from your parents? That's for you to find out. I just hope that you won't avoid an opportunity to improve, and let your mental health deteriorate far worse than it is now on the condition of avoiding confrontation with your parents.

Hopefully i'm helping at least a little, here, and not coming off as condescending in any way.",,0.0,,2014-10-01 19:36:31,,,0,False,,,,0,,ckxoc4s,,,,,t3_2hzmqm,,,t1_ckxoc4s,,,,t1_ckxldfr,,,,,,,,1426733561.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

So I've been dealing on and off with depression since high school.  I'm a junior in college now.  Last year I was sexually assaulted, and apparently my coping mechanism for that is now depersonalization (random, intense feelings of being Not Me).  It's scary and I'm seeing someone for it, but the message I'm getting is that it's not really something that goes away except with a long amount of time and a lot of work.  I just....feel overwhelmed and am falling back into depressive thought patterns and can't seem to escape.

And now it's even worse because I just started dating my best friend.  I love him tons and want this to work out so. bad. but I'm worried my issues are too much to put on him.  I don't want to be the energy drainer in a relationship, especially with him because I care about him.  So it makes me hate myself even more and try not to deal with feelings I really should be thinking through.

I'll explain what I mean.

I'm a medical student (from poor background) in a public hospital, where I see medical errors happening very often -- trainee doctors work here to start their careers before being able to work for rich people in the private sector, if they make it. This basically triggered my realisation that natural selection in our species occurs on the basis of wealth. Rich people live longer, have more resources, their kids have better opportunities and so on. Furthermore, pretty much any human activity involves some financial transaction. Especially things you do make yourself feel better in the short term (e.g. buy chocolate, coffee, alcohol) benefit the wealthy class while making the underclass less healthy long term while having to work more to afford these things.

It's one of those things you can't 'unsee'. Now I just view every person as a 'number' representing their net worth, and see how they purchase this or that, or think how many dollars their car blows out the exhaust pipe or how much it cost to feed them that day.
I also realise how my own study is just an investment by hospital board members -- maybe I'll have the luxury of treating them one day.

I've tried antidepressants and counselling etc but I can't shake the feeling that this is just a psychopathic game of natural selection we are all playing in a vane attempt to survive a little longer.

I think my first struggle was working out that I actually had depression. It's a difficult thing to admit to yourself, but with help from many of my friends, and random people from the internet, telling me to go and see a doctor, and it was easily the best decision of my life. The next struggle was telling my family about my illness. I've not cried in front of my parents since I was a baby as I always tried to hide my emotions from them. I didn't know how they would react, but they were so supportive of me, and I really thank them for it, even if I do still struggle to express my true emotions to them.

I've been taking Fluoxetine for a few months now. The first two weeks were hell, but after I almost immediately felt better about my self. Along with the medicine, the overall support I've had from everyone has had the most impact on me, without them I don't know if I'd still be here, and I really mean that. I'm not much of a talker, so it's difficult for me to tell them this but I plan to make it known to them some day.

The scariest part of depression, in my opinion is the inability to do anything. People don't understand what it's like because you don't know what it's like unless they've really been through it.

That I feel so alone, that i feel like i have this deep dark secret hanging over me that no one else can see. 

I keep thinking recently how much I'd like to die. How I could do it etc. etc. I haven't felt like this in such a long time. I've had awful problems when I was younger, huge horrible problems. That trauma is in my past now but I'm stuck in my life and miserable. And when I was younger i got through it by believing that eventually, when I was older, independent and doing OK finanically then it would fall into place. 

But my finances are fucked. I can't get a break with job hunting. I have this heavy weight of knowledge that I will never have a bond with someone the way your supposed to (marriage/kids) that if I did I'd be faking the closeness. Becuase I feel like a different species. I can gel with people, I've had relationships, but I've always felt alone. Like being in a culture that is different to my own so you can explain that in your culture you do X on Christmas day, and maybe they will do X wiht you becuase they like you, but its not the same as doing it with people who are excited about it and have done it every Christmas since they can reember.  And there is this horrible sinking feeling now that this IS it. That this is my life. That I can take all the pills and therapy and my life would still be this. I am stuck in the fog of depression, knowing that there are probably steps I could take to make my life better. But I can't see them. And I'm so heavy and tired I don't feel like I can do them. Its like having a bucket list when you have a terminal illness, and battling with yourself whether its worse really really pushing yourself to complete something on it when you could just lie back and sleep a bit more.

I should probably state I'm not about to do anything. I'm older than I was when I first felt like this, then I was a teenager and unaware of how upset everyone would be. I'm going to stick around becuase it would be unbeliavable cruel to do this to my sister when she (like me obviously) has lost so many family members already. So I'll just keep chugging along.

68670,,True,TryingToSmile2012,,,,"The goal of anti-depressents, as I understand it, essentially to work to stop the brain absorbing seratonin at such a fast rate. Ideally over time,  like two weeks to a month, the brain has built up enough seratonin to start elevating your mood to 'normal' levels. It's like how some people have a fast metablosim and some have slow ones to make a struggle for an analogy. 

When MDMA is used it releases all this stored up seratonin, flooding you with the chemical that makes you happy, which is why people get a 'come-down' for the next few days when having taken it, they've used up a large amount of seratonin which takes some time to build up again.

To get back to anti-deppresents, I don't think they're addictive depending on the situation. It can be used as a short-term solution to help when you're really at a low, for example when something bad happens to cause a change of mood, like a death or something. 

Other times I feel it has to be treated as you might look upon insulin for diabetics. The body doesn't function properly so you have to make adjustments.

They're not an easy answer though, they're not totally accurate and you can't effect the one part of the body witout effecting another and as we're all built so differently, different SSRI's (selective seratonin Re-Uptake Inhibitor) effect different people differently (for example, small amounts of anti-deppresents are prescribed for premature ejaculation). Hence, it might take a few tries to find the appropriate medication.

You are right of course, we're never as alone as we think. Being the product of thousands upon thousands of generations of frisky humans, it is almost a guarentee that not only are there living people that feel exactly like you do, there are tons more that lived in the past that felt that way too.

People are as they are, and it's a sobering thought. The same fundemental questions and feelings we are talking about tonight, over an unfathomably complicated network that I couldn't even begin to really understand, are the same ones people have talked about since we crawled out of the trees.

My family was cleaning out my deceased grandparents house, so everyone was just a little crazy. My sister came up from her house and she had recently injured her foot. My aunt and uncle and her two kids came up from Rhode Island. Nothing wrong with that. 

It gets a little crazy and hectic in the story of the weekend that i had. Since they came up, the kids are 11 and 8 years old, they know how my grandmother died and how my grandfather died. Needless to say they do not like to be in certain areas of the house alone. Perfectly fine, my father was getting mad at them because they would not for the life of them go and get bubble wrap. He sent me, I am not fond of certain rooms but, I deal with it. 

Any way, since my sister had a foot injury she couldnt do alot of lifting or much of anything because she couldnt walk. Now since i was doing most of the work that she would have done on top of my work, I was getting pretty exhausted. With that being said, I was getting cranky because by this point my cousins were getting winded and I was doing there work as well. Now I am a pretty collected person, but this was too much for me.

By the time we finished, I was nearly snapping at everyone including my father. He did more work than me since he started earlier and most of the heavy heavy lifting he did. Aside from that i did a lot as well. The three floors in that house are pretty bad, its small, cramped and the air either did not work or the fans did not work. When we went upstairs it was even hotter. I had asked my moms younger sister, if certain things i could have because my mother said that it was ok.

Somehow someone changed the story, I got in trouble because I 'lied' and when i confronted my mother she told me that 'hey your an outcast in all of this, you shouldnt have even opened your mouth, your just there to do work'. Ok fine then, I was doing the work and then I am being told by my mothers sister that if I wanted it she would let me have them IF, because she was going to treat me like her kids. At this point I was already cranky, hot, sweaty, exhausted and fed up. So I not thinking said 'Your not my mother, I am not your kid I am 18'. 

By the time i realized this it was already too late. I feel like shit now that it is like the day after i said all of this. My boyfriend caught wind of what happened and is breaking up with me because of my little snap that i had. He is all the way in California. He hears things about me, that i have done six months ago and holds it over my head like a kid dose to a dog before they get scolded for teasing the dog.

Nobody said anything all day yesterday about what happened, I get told today that he wants to break up, the ring he gave me i have to give to my mother who is holding on to it because he like i said wants to break up with me. Meanwhile he holds shit over my head taunting me, almost mocking me. If i so much as hold something over his head, i get bitched and yelled at for it. I am basically his pawn. I havent seen him in over five years, because every single time that I ask him if he can come down to Jersey, he pulls the same bullshit excuse of he has work to do or he has family things to do. 

One day he even went as far to say that his mother broke her foot. He knows i talk to his mother, just the same as he talks to mine. I asked her how her broken foot was, she asked me what I meant and when i explained it to her that her younger son said that she broke her foot she just said that it wasnt broken and he went out. I am waiting for him to come to Jersey like a jackass and i find out that he goes out most times. I feel like i have a thumb up my ass for him and he could be having the time of his life. 

I was so tormented by my actual mother (my step mother is the person whom i talked about today, i now call her my mother) that I feel like all this emotional abuse is right. I fell like it is ok to be treated like this. It seems right because My real mother was a woman to constantly go out of her way to keep my father in the dark for thirteen years and cheat on her boyfriends and all of her husbands. It seems natural that this treatment is perfectly normal. I just dont know what to do. My boyfriend broke up with me, my sister is not speaking to me for some unknown reason, my father is mad at me because I didnt do one thing, my step mom is mad at me for saying what i did to her sister when I did work and she sat at home sleeping because she cant walk up stairs due to her knees giving out and her bad back.

When I think of everything bad that's happened then I think of possibilities for the future, it's very hard not to get crushed by it all, then I realise there are people much worse off than me and I feel guilty for feeling the way I do.

I'll tell you about friends. About the ones that made me smile, the ones that made me cry, and about the ones that stabbed me in the back and disappointed me. Together they all teach you who you can be, and no regrets should be felt.

I'll tell you about self worth, it's found in the little things you ignore. That short smirk you gave to yourself in the mirror, that shirt you knows that fits you well.

I can't tell you what it's like not to hurt. But I'll tell you that without hurt, we cannot learn to value safety. 

I'll listen to you and your creative methods of marking and end. While I hold your hands telling you that I understand, while you stand there in disbelief.

I'll tell you how I get through the day. I make sure others have someone that will listen, because I never had that for myself, and it drove me to hell.

I'll tell you about how you finding a bit of hope in this message is the greatness in my life.

Because keeping who you are is one of the most important reasons not to give up on life. 

I can't tell you why everyone is so far away, and I can't tell you how to bring them back. People come and go, but you must keep in your heart how they made you feel, because if saying goodbye was hard, then you had someone worth saying goodbye to. 

I can't tell you how to get through anxiety attacks, but you got this far and you're still alive. And undying warrior lies in your body, acknowledge it. 

I'll tell you that shame is not yours. It belongs to the judgmental people that surround you. Free yourself.

I don't know how down you are, but if you ever need to go to the emergency room it'll help them a lot if you can say you were diagnosed and that it's not just a hunch. A GP can also tell you about therapy and antidepressants (if they feel it's needed). Ask them away, they're there to service you.

You don't specifically need a referral, but in some places you can save a lot of money getting one -- for instance, if I have a referral my insurance company will pay a small part of the bill. And you need to seek out a therapist -- a psychologist, I reckon. And you just find a list of all them in your area and call them up. You need to feel like you can talk to this person so don't just pick the first on the list.

19292,,True,shallah,,,,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was a tween. Anxiety w/panic, depression, ocd. The ones I saw when young didn't do a damn thing for me. they were recommended by my doctor, my school or whomever had an opening when a crisis occured. when through various medications in my teens without positive effect. eventually found someone who was a body centered psychotherapist who combined bodywork with psychology. She helped alot, I came out of the depression for several years bt still struggled with anxiety, ocd. she urged me several times to check out other therapists but I didn't until she retired. Then I read up on the different types of therapy and decided to find someone who used mindfulness type techniques as they are supposed to help increase tolerance of one's emotions . plus i wanted to try emdr for trauma. I tried one who did mindfulness based congitive therapy but we didn't click plus parking was a huge hassle so after a few sessions she suggested someone else with excellent credentials but no openings for new clients. I found a group practice in my area that had a variety of therapists trained in Dialectical behavior Therapy &amp; emdr. I did an intake evaluation w/the supervisor who recommended a dbt therapist. I liked her a lot but she got sick and decided to get out of trauma work. Got someone else and I really like her too. She gets (and uses) sarcasm and dark humor which puzzled or freaked out some I had gone to in the past. I am making major progress for the first time in years and it helped me get through things that in the past led to major meltdowns. I have a therapist that I can properly spill my guts with only a little hesitation - trust is hard for me.

sorry to ramble, hope I am coherent....

My suggestion is to look at what issues you have that hold you back in life and read up a the types of therapy out there for them. In my case I have multiple issues including trauma so I wanted to be sure I got someone with experience in that. 1) I wanted someone who knew how to treat me &amp; 2) I didn't want to get the puzzled and/or semifreaked out reactions I got from the clueless therapists in the past. 

I looked for a group of councilors so if one didn't work out I could switch without having to totally start from scratch with the new person. Therapists are not deities so you have the right to say someone does not suit you and you want to try someone else. also I was interested in group therapy as I have social anxiety and since turned out to be part of dbt it is easier to have with some group work when there are enough clients to make it work like it supposed to.

a suggestion ... write down your issues before you start looking for a therapist and write down the questions you want to ask such as do they take your insurance, what is their training and experience and their areas of focus, would you prefer a female or male therapist, if religious do you want a therapist of your faith or none or just willing to let people have a faith or none as the client prefers, sense of humor preference (I actually requested that in addtion to someone who does emdr) , &amp;stuff like that. btw I panic calling people on the phone so I was lucky the places I contacted had email which was less harrowing so that once I confirmed they had therapists trained in my problem areas who took my insurance and had decent parking it was easier to call and make the intake appointment.",,0.0,,2012-04-28 23:35:23,,,0,False,,,,0,,c4hrgwv,,,,,t3_sww93,,,t1_c4hrgwv,,,,t3_sww93,,,,,,,,1428816508.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

Last year, I was living with my friends in our apartment, and I went to stay at my parents' for Christmas to give them time together. They were getting married on the 28th, blah blah, nice stuff. It almost came down to me not even being sure I'd be alive for the wedding, let alone AT it after a careless comment from my mom about not having mental issues. Clearly I do, but she doesn't listen to me ever. She still says very harsh and careless and thoughtless things, but nothing's caused me to go into a spin like that since.

But a couple weeks ago, my brother came down on me and it's been really bothering me since. I'm two-spirit, bi and was recently dating a guy. I like to dress male sometimes, other times quite girly, most of the time somewhere in the middle. Well, that doesn't fly with my brother, because he knows all, and thinks that I should dress for my partner, blah blah, not nice shit, very much not understanding or supportive. (There is some sarcasm in that sentence.) when that happened, instead of having a good time drinking with a friend and playing video games and having a good time, I ended up going to bed angry and sober.

Well i suffered pretty heavily from depression and anxiety for many years and for the last yr and a bit i believe i had over come it, today tho made me question it, it was like i just got out of the wrong side of the bed, had a crap sleep, just nothing but stress from work all morning, ontop of that it felt like my lungs were just being stubbed over and over, so it was that physical (or mental) pain of that plus just abuse from customers from work.

All of it just sent my stress through the roof and out of no where it feel like my depression just decided to jump in and slap me around, everything from just feeling like i deserved what i got today and i should always just feel crap so i didn't even eat all day, it just brought back so much stuff i thought i dealt and overcome with.

But i was driving home from work and i felt worse just as my shift ended cause i knew i was going home and i was alone all night tonight, alone with my stupid head and thoughts, but funny thing happened on the way home, i had my phone hocked up to the car and it was playing music and this one song came on, it was the Music clip to Jinx from LoL, random i know but that one song reminded me how much my gf actually loved it.

it was strange but from there my afternoon improved, i came home, had a shower, turned on my pc and started playing Dark Souls, next thing i know a few hours have pasted, anyway after a amazing talk with my gf and just some time alone to relax and listen to music and play some games (which i used previously as my ""fix me up"" cure xD).

I guess why im posting this in the end, is because you may of seen my posts on other peoples posts, i just wanna say you should never give up fighting depression and anxiety, you will relapse like i did but the longer you fight it the easier it all becomes :)

I'm lying in my bed, thinking at night, like I always did.  I used to tell my parents when I couldn't sleep, ""my stomach is empty and my mind is full.""

So, anyway, I'm lying there, and I think about how life isn't fair.  This is a concept that honestly was pretty easy to understand, but what was hard on me was thinking about the repurcussions.  My childish brain thought along the lines of,

-Life isn't fair.
-Life was unfair.
-Life is unfair.
-Life will always be unfair.
-I can't change it.
-Others can't change it.
-Or they won't.
-I hate them.
-But it's not their fault.
-Because Life is Not Worth Living by itself.
-And that's scary.
-So scary I might not want to continue...
-But death is scary too.

So I screamed that night to my dad, and when he came to check on me, I begged him to kill me.  I screamed for almost half an hour, and was inconsolable on the matter until I fell asleep out of exhaustion.

Fast forward, and I've basically felt like my entire life is compensating for the lack of inherent value in the world itself.

God often was a concept that made me feel angry.  If God made me, then he could have chosen a different path.  If his plan for me involves this experience, then I hate him.  If God exists, I decided, I would rather kill Him than worship him.

So atheism came pretty easily on an intellectual level, but I've always been very spiritual, and Daoism honestly helped me a lot as well.  It taught me about the inherent value of everything, and how the concept of Unfairness requires the existence of Fairness, which is an illusion we create.  But despite being an illusion, it also means that fairness is a Human Creation, thereby meaning that humanity is the source of all fairness, which for me was a reason to value life - my own and that of others.

If any human around me was capable of living up to the potential of Fairness, Kindness, or any other virtue, then there was no reason to hate them, or myself.

Patience became the most valuable skill I could develop, along with self-awareness.

By this time, I was around 13.  I was also an awkward nerdy kid with no social skills and an entire adolescent life full of unrequitted desire to be loved, sexually and emotionally.

This was all compounded rather unfortunately when I discovered that while my attraction to girls was totally normal, and I was grateful for that, I was different: I thought vaginas were gross.  I still do, and it's pretty much the worst thing in my life.  Worse than depression, my weird phobia or whatever it is has made me feel alone, and given me so much guilt that I assume that no woman would ever want me once they knew my secret.

It's worth mentioning that I have been thinking about suicide, and deciding against it through nothing more than my own sheer force of will, for around 18 years since that night of thinking.  Never attempted once.  I'm very proud of that.

But despite all my accomplishments in surviving the feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and despite having a relationship (an open one, even), and being well-liked with many friends, I feel like I am the most pathetic person I know, simply because I have achieved nothing more solid than my own continued existence.

Basically, trying to keep myself from suicide has taken so much effort, I've managed to hold fewer than five jobs in my life at 24 years old, work less than 40 weeks in that time, not have a degree, and generally have almost nothing to call my own.

It's infuriating, because I seem to be reaching a point of no return, past which it is becoming unacceptable for me to have so few accomplishments.  My intellect, in fact, holds me back, because I appear lazy, when in fact I am tired, afraid, and just about done living.

My entire life has been a battle of attrition, and I don't know if I will be alive in five years.

I've never had a plan that I didn't feel disgust towards, and I've never wanted one.

That, I think is the toughest thing.  I'm unable to trick myself into enjoying life, or appreciating anything that isn't actually special.

Despite working as hard as I do to not only stay alive, but also help my friends, and love the people in my life with as much gusto and heartfelt affection as I can, no matter how that might manifest... I am an asshole.

I am an asshole, and I want to die, because I'm tired of being disappointed with myself, and feeling like my continued existence is the equivalent of holding onto a sad relationship: you are worried more about what life is like when you leave it, than about how you can improve it.

Anyway, that was a pointless rant i felt like writing for no particular reason.

He was diagnosed as a teenager, he had a traumatic childhood experience, and he quit his medical treatment when he met me. He was doing alright up until about 6 months ago. I think the stress of a new job got to him.

He began being very quiet, withdrawn, and very nasty towards me. He says he knows that he is taking things out on me, but it almost seems as if he thinks that's ok. In front of his friends, however, he can be his lovely, funny, out-spoken self...

He eventually dumped me 2 months ago, but after 3 weeks of NC he asked me to get back together, saying that it was his depression that caused him to break up, and that he realised that i wasn't the reason for his unhappiness and that he needs me. 

However, he found out that I have been talking about our relationship to mutual friends, and that I have been telling them that I was worried about him, and he can't seem to forgive me for that. While we are back together, every other day he'd just suddenly withdraw again and start blaming me for that situation in the most horrible ways. 

Now I haven't heard from him in 3 days, which is not uncommon, but I feel that he is so angry and that he hates me :( All I want is to take care of him, cook for him, try and cheer him up.

First of all, I'd like to just say that it goes further than the depression and anxiety that they suffer. I have personally suffered from these things my entire adult life so far (we are both in our mid 20s [M]). I have a fair amount of life experience coping with the illness myself and supporting family members.
However, drugs have become involved and this is an area that I am relatively unfamiliar with.

I have known the guy for a couple of years and we happened to move away to the same university and decided to share a house in our second year. I was always aware that he was a fairly anxious person like me, but at the start of this academic year I started to see that he was becoming quite depressed (skipping classes, irregular sleeping, lack of appetite, amongst other things). We have spoken a little about it, and he had asked for my advice/support with it. I pointed him in the direction of various counselling services that the university provide and talked him into seeing a GP (all good right?). 

Well, he saw the GP roughly 10 days ago, and met with student support (if I take his word - I have no reason to doubt him). But since then has **attempted suicide twice**. The second time being this morning and I'm writing this after the ambulance has taken him away. 

I have known that he is fairly liberal about drug use, and he is a very smart and sensible person. I was not concerned at first when he admitted to buying/using some substances to get a little high. I even smoked marijuana with him on a few occasions over the past couple of months. I have since realised that I was fairly naive when it came to some pills that he had ordered online. He told me that they were used in other countries as antidepressants and to treat anxiety. He explained that he had done extensive research and was now self medicating to try and improve his mood. I wouldn't say that I was not worried at all, I even told him I felt it wasn't a good idea. As I feel like a prescription drug from the GP (which I take myself) is more well known in it's affects. However, I trusted his judgement and that he was not in any danger. 
As I said, since he has been self medicating on this drug for the past month of two, and mixing with other substances he has begun to concern me greatly.

Obviously this is quite a serious situation now as I have nearly lost him twice. Fortunately, he has panicked and called an ambulance both times...but what if next time he can't? or chooses not to?

I feel like I've done everything I know how to, in order to support him with what he's going through. But as I'm his only close friend in this town and his housemate, I feel quite responsible!
Drugs, and drug abuse is not something I have much experience with personally. I'm not completely ignorant, but I have come here to ask for some advice...and perhaps a little support from those of you that might know a little more.

Thanks again.

As you know I handed in assignments and even missed exams which made me even worse regardless of the facade that I put on in front of others. 

What I did, talk to one of your professors (informally/formally doesn't matter), preferably Head of Dept. or a senior lecturer and tell him/her about your ordeal and what personal circumstances have lead to your current situation. What happened for me was that during their meeting (for referral exams/essays) he pushed for me to be marked as ""first sitting"" which means I will not be deducted 40% of the marks and it will be treated as if I was sitting it for the first time. I'm from the UK and I'm not sure where you're from but each country must have a higher education system similar to this.

Hopefully they will sympathise and put you down as first sitting on essays and exams (usually late August for UK). That is when you do have to do something, get your head down and study hard.

That is what I would do regarding the academic area of things. As for the counselling, if possible request someone, it should be acceptable if you explain to them that you cannot connect with your current counsellor.

Sorry for the wall of text.

It's the end of the quarter so I'm already stressed as is with my final projects. About 2 weeks ago I decided that I'm unhappy living with my current roommates, so I told them I was planning to move out (falling out ensued, now one of them is not speaking to me), but I would help them find someone take my place. Maybe 10 minutes later, they decided on the girl I had kind of been talking to about moving in with. ""She just knows us better."" Okay, that's whatever, I get it, it's cool. I told them I was going to try to find a place and move sometime around June with another girl I knew, Rachel.

Well, Rachel found out she wouldn't be able to move until around August, so I let my roommates know. Their response was, ""Well Natalie needs a place to live ASAP so she was planning on moving in at the end of the quarter (two weeks from now). Guess I'm just shit out of luck. I considered just moving back home for a month or two, but my parents just sold the house. My grandmother lives about 45 min away, but it wouldn't be worth driving back and forth from work everyday to do that. So now I'm gonna be crashing on a co-worker's couch and paying $200 a month for rent. And while I feel like I am the cause for all of my frustration and misery, I still am sitting here feeling sorry for myself. I don't really know what to do. I have no motivation to do anything like ride my bike, or work on stuff for school. I just want to sit here and cry.

115256,,True,SirDuck36,,,,"It's easy to feel when you are down that you would be a weight on anybody that you talked to about it.  Try mentally turning the situation around though, what do you feel like when people open up to you with their problems?  How much strain do you experience hearing about their struggle?  Do you feel any compensating factors?  In particular I have in mind two major examples: the relief in the knowledge that these struggles are a shared human experience, and the opportunity to make something positive out of the pain you have experienced in your life and that you know the other person is going through.

My day is better for being able to talk to you, not worse, and I hope you will find the same of me, *hug*.

&gt; I get it. Get out of your own box and see outside the box. I know, that easy, right? I know what to do. Focus on work, you'll feel better. But why can't I just do it?

This question of ""Why can't I get myself to just do these things that I know are good for me?"" has bothered me for a long time.  That question has lead me on a lengthy search ending up in a research topic called ""behavioral design,"" partially targeted toward marketing companies that want you to buy or use a particular product obsessively, but also partially targeted and particularly useful for making effective life changes in your own behavior.  In any case, this is what has finally really worked for me.  Googling for ""behavioral design"", ""tiny habits"" and ""BJ Fogg"" will turn up lots of info, but here are the highlights:

* **Motivation** is important, but honestly if you have gotten this far, you already have a lot of motivation to make your life better.  Motivation is the one of the hardest things to change in behavior anyway, so don't spend your effort here until you've exhausted the other two items.
* **Ability factors** are easy to affect and are often overlooked until you sit down and analyze the problem.  The simplest form of this is to make the task simple... ridiculously simple.  Want to start flossing?  Floss one tooth.  Want to start running every morning?  Put on your running pants.  Want to read more?  Pick up a book and read one sentence.  The key once you have done these things is to then *celebrate* the fact that you successfully completed what you set out to do.  Take time, acknowledge it, and then if you feel like doing more, go for it.  If not, come back and succeed at the same task the next day which you can totally do, because you've reduced the difficulty of the task to almost nothing.  The things you have retained though, the combination of an action, successful completion of that action and celebration of that success, are all very effective in establishing behavior change.  The full on behavior that you are looking to achieve will grow naturally out of what you have seeded if you give it enough chance to do so.
* **Triggers** are massively important.  The are so fundamental to behavior that no behavior ever occurs without a trigger event.  The interesting thing here is that they are so deeply built into the way we live our lives, they can be hard to even see sometimes.  For example, I make a pot of coffee every single morning, that's a behavior.  What's the trigger?  I make coffee after I take my vitamins, and so taking my vitamins is the trigger for making coffee.  It seems trivial, but these chains of event triggers guide us invisibly through most of our waking hours.  The cool thing is that it's pretty easy to setup new triggers.  A sign on the bathroom door will remind you that you want to do a (single) pushup every time you want to go to the bathroom.  A note on the coffee pot reminds me that I decided that every morning after I make my coffee, I want to close my eyes and take a deep relaxing breath.  Setting my homepage to my morning log that I fill out every day reminds me that this is the first thing I do every time I turn on my computer in the morning.",,0.0,,2014-02-07 15:45:55,,,0,False,,,,0,,cf9fha7,,,,,t3_1x8pf6,,,t1_cf9fha7,,,,t3_1x8pf6,,,,,,,,1432295281.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

By the way, half of what you said is regarding one of the most terrifying aspects of depression. It's an illness that manipulates your thoughts to keep you from getting help. The nearly-self harm doesn't sound pathetic to me at all. It means you've figured out how to avoid directing stress and anger inward. I'm trying to work on that myself.

But in the long term, it will help us see the beauty in the world that we may have lost along the way or possibly we have yet to see. I'm not trying to give this overly optimistic response.

In my 3rd year of university, studying engineering. Having recently gone to a GP and expressed concernes for my mental health he narrowed it down to depression. I had walked into the GP's office knowing more likely than not that something was wrong with me.

Confirmation seems to have made it worse. I'm seeing a counseller at uni tomorrow, and there's a 6 week waiting list to see a private psychologist. Even getting better is going to take a while.

It's the last week of uni this week and I have a total of 5 assessments awaiting me. 3 assignments, one interview on a project and a reading and writing test for a language course. Thinking how much shit I have to deal with this week has made me freak the fuck out and withdraw into nothing. I am nothing. I feel nothing. I'm so terrified my brain and my body just respond to nothing. I know time is ticking away and I'm losing it, but I continue sitting here, letting it run past me as I struggle to pick myself up.

In times like this I would normally cry and give myself that release. I can't. I can't cry anymore. I'm just an empty shell. Nothing.

I'm terrified, so so terrified......

I feel like I'm not listened to by the two people I love most in the world. So when I feel like I'm not listened to or they know what's best, I just think I'm a burden. Maybe they act differently because they are fed up of me and just going through the motions. 

That's why I write everything down, because different days I feel differently, or I see things differently. Sometimes worse, sometimes better. At least with writing everything down you can get everything out and you can go back and read it and try and figure out what happened at that time that made you feel that way. Could it have been avoided or do you need to talk to that person. 

Maybe you could try that? Depressed people are very paranoid :( we push away the people who are trying to help.

I don't really know what I should do. I have been lurking here but I feel like I have been lurking in all things through my life. I know that posting to a depression subreddit may not be the best place to look for some sort of reprieve. However, I have no other option at this point. I do not know whether or not I should seek help or just continue on in this hallow living. 

There are some issues with me seeking help; I am a Military member who is currently stationed at a base that requires you to meet certain requirements, which make you ""reliable."" I am not happy. I know that. I wish that I could be. I just don't know if I am not well adjusted or an over thinker. It is getting worse though. I have been having recent thoughts on how and what would be the easiest way to end my life. I have even opted to Google for ""student research"" on how many sleeping pills it would take for me to cease from existing. 

I don't know how to seek help. I am lost. I am not alone and I am living a fulfilled existence. It feels like I am a functioning alcoholic where you replaced the alcohol with this feeling of emptiness. I don't know where to go or what I should do. I feel like this is a cry for help. If it weren't then I wouldn't even be typing this.

Drunk is pretty much the only way I'm able to write anything like this, but tonight I've been feeling rather down.

I mean if I am a girl/woman on the inside, and want to wear a dress and that makes me happy then that should be all that matters right?

The breaking point could be anything like a rough break up, or nearly failing a year, or just, you know, realising it's gotten to a point where I'm so disconnected and isolated and numb that I wouldn't mind just not waking up one day.

The first time I felt that way I promised myself I would never let myself get to that point again and that if it ever got anywhere near as bad I would get over my ego and get some help. But then I never did, I just stuck to my various shitty old coping mechanisms - smoking, alcohol, weed, overeating or undereating, isolating myself from virtually everyone and trying to wait it out / cry it out, or distracting myself with lots of boozy socialising, or fucking around - all sorts of contradictory things to either numb myself down or give myself a false sense of control over things.

I really don't want to do any of that anymore. For the first time in a while I'm in a pretty good place - I care about myself and about other people too, and I've got people who genuinely care, and things to look forward to.

Unfortunately, I'm stubborn as fuck and sceptical about the idea of therapy. My one and only experience of talking to a psychologist as a kid (not about me per se, just as a compulsory part of my parents' divorce proceedings) ended with me leaving the room shaking and crying, which I at least partially attribute to the two docs being very pushy and unpleasant - it felt more like and interrogation and they made me feel like my feelings were not valid at all, and while I know it's silly to be bitter about one shitty experience, it really was quite off putting.

I also know it's about fucking time I got some help because I've now got years' worth of undealt with stuff, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere.

I'm fucking scared though and I don't know how the fuck to talk about this to anyone I actually know. My dad's been struggling with depression for a large chunk of his life and I don't even know how he's doing know (he hasn't lived with us for the past decade and has a new family which I get along with but it's obviously been different) - but I only know about his issues from scraps of second hand information. I've witnessed him being a right mess first hand though, so I feel torn between wanting to talk to him because he out of all the people could probably understand me best and feeling like I can't burden him with any negative feelings I have because he'd take it personally and I don't want him to blame himself for not being there enough or anything.

I've tried talking to my mum in the past, but I'd usually just get the usual motherly tough love I get from her. Or she'd take it a bit personally / as a dig at her parenting skills too, which I don't blame her for. She's a million times better a mum to me than both of her parents were to her anyway. She was abused by a slightly more distant family member as a kid and they put all the blame on her and pretty much forbid her from talking about it - so I feel like shit whenever I complain about anything, given how rough she's had it (I kind of wish I could tell her about how I was pretty much assaulted a few years back, just to get it out in the open, and maybe help her open up about her past more if she ever wants to - it might be selfish of me, but nobody in the family knows and I don't think it's fair at all - but what happened to me wasn't anywhere near as bad, and I haven't told anyone else either, and I wouldn't want her to worry)

I'm scared of not being taken seriously and I'm scared of being taken seriously too. Bit like in Jenny Owen Youngs' Drinking Song - ""I don't know what's wrong with me but I wish that it was something else"".

I know this is far too long a wall of text to expect any replies, but ta anyway. It was kind of nice just throwing that out there, even if I still don't know what I'm gonna do.

TL;DR: Just a rant. I'm a bit of a mess, but trying to pretend otherwise. I guess I just needed to admit to myself I'm not okay and may need help, and that's ok too.

The most logical answer is that she entered a time of her life where you did suddenly mean nothing to her.

&gt; After all of that, how could what I thought we had together be so inherently disposable?

It was disposable because she recognized a better incompatible opportunity.

There is a mechanism in you where you can make the decision to devote the least amount of energy to her and move on with your life's success. In Christian cultures the mechanism is called ""forgiveness"". Without specifying which mechanism you should use, the fact remains that the most self-loving action you can take is to decide to devote the least amount of future energy to her, and then do so.

&gt; and my own guilt have been the monkey on my back.

I don't understand, where is your own sense of guilt coming from?

&gt; I prefer a more holistic approach involving changes in dieting, exercise and generally trying to prioritize and hone my inner focus on the important things in my life

&gt; It progressed and has led to alcoholism, self-confidence issues and a nasty smoking habit.

I don't recommend taking a fist full of prescription drugs, but how would that be worse than alcoholism and smoking. You are in conflict over your health.

I, myself, was a virgin up to the age of 25 and completely loveless and alone up to that age as well. I guess I was lucky because I didn't have an idealized relationship in my past that distorted my judgement about really-existing romantic relationships. Trust me, I don't feel lucky, I am often bitter about how lonely my first quarter century of living was, because I never had a innocent and sweet youthful romance.

Lets decide now to make *me* the pathetic one. I hurt for you because this past relationship has a grip over your successful future. Meditate and decide how to devote the very very very least amount of energy to this relationship in your future life, for your future success. There is a Christian tradition of total forgiveness - accept it or reject it, but you have to find a way to stop devoting so much energy to this past relationship.

I guess I’m now getting experience in entrepreneurship in some degree. 

After some time I got accepted to University in England But thinking I’d be fine financially I  chose not to acknowledge our financial status for some reason which I know would become a problem later. Since the acceptance I’ve become more antsy and decided to be out of the house on a regular bases doing activities and hanging out with my friends. Which kept some happiness in me for some time, I had no complaints and no trouble being positive.

Recently I got involved in an car accident and since then I’ve become less social, feeling depressed, keeping to myself more, stuck inside my room after coming home from work and then on top of that I couldn’t go off to university due to financial issues (which I expected). As of right now I feel as If I’m going day to day doing the same things over and over again expecting things to change…I have no motivation, no drive, no want, no will to get something done. I don’t know what to do anymore, on a daily basis my mind is blank as if I’m on autopilot. I’ve had friends tell me I went M.I.A and I know this but I couldn’t give a reason why…I hadn’t sit down and thought about it at the time when I was informed.

How I envisioned my life compared to how I’m living it now is like two sides of a coin…It’s like I just turned around on a stairway to now slowly walk downstairs and I can’t seem to come to a conclusion why. I know want to be financially free, I want to travel the world, I want do amazing things, I wanted to BE an amazing person, now all those things I envisioned in my head came crashing down like glass. I feel like I’m now stuck in life and I don’t know how to become unstuck, I don’t know how I would go about making significant changes. 

I lived my life becoming accustomed to dealing with many things on my own, I rarely go to my friends for emotional or physical help. I guess I’m looking for help now but in a sense that other people can give me advice as well…a third eye if you will. I’ve struggled all my life even thought about suicide but convinced myself it wouldn’t make any sense and so I keep moving forward but like I said…I feel stuck right now.

I’m just looking for a motivational pep talk, advice on scholarships or something to help toward university, any advice to change the way I’m thinking and make changes in my life I guess…idk, something.

Learning healthy boundaries has helped me keep friends long term rather than just attract people who need an emotional prop.

I'd suggest looking at books about building friendships/people skills on Amazon, reading the customer reviews will give you an idea whether those particular books will apply to you.

i was dating this guy for 2 years... well over 2 years. before we started dating we were on and off. i told him to leave me alone as he was in love with this girl he had never met before but just talked to via facetime and over the phone lots. eventually, months later, he came back to me and we started hanging out again. at the beginning of our relationship something different happened. we both had a burning/tingling feeling ""down there"" went to the doctor and found out i had herpes. (he never got official answers but he had it too). we swore to each other we would get through it together. both of us had been idiots and slept with someone else without a condom. 
however, everything was fantastic, honeymoon stage for about a year and half. he worked out of town, but we made it work. i ended up having to go back to school, his work started getting stressful. we fell apart. the last 6 months of it was terrible. i found hookers phone numbers in his phone (yes i went through his phone. call it girls intuition of lies), said he never called them or met with any... i also found some emails sent to the girl i mentioned earlier, wanting to meet up with her. we were in mexico together. he emailed her while sitting beside me. i still don't, till this day, understand how that's possible for someone to do. 
anyways. there was a bit more. he would lie to me constantly about smoking pot to make it ""less of a big deal"" and just.. stupid little lies that i could never understand why he lied about it. 
we just started fighting. all the time. every time we talked, i would cry. i eventually told him i needed a break. he joined pof the very next day. (maybe i'm overly pathetic, i dunno. but i figured he'd do something stupid like that so i checked pof. no account. just to see if he would and he did). 
called him on it. i'm guessing he was embarrassed or whatever. he lashed out at me saying he knew i had an account. he knew i didn't. just said shit. pretty sure he's really insecure about being caught red handed with things but.. in any case
so that was it. i said it was over. yeah we're on a break. but the point was to make him see how much he missed me or something. stupid right?

i went out and i bought myself a condo. i got a new job. i had to trade in my baby. the vehicle in which i loved soo much. i got a car. don't get me wrong, it's a super nice car. but i had to give up my baby. 

so here i am. at my new job... which has grown boring with it's repetitively boring days. a lack of friends. i try and make girl friends. i just don't know what to say to them. i had a best friend. she started working out of town. we grew apart. she included me in a lie to her boyfriend. i stopped talking to her. i contacted her a year later, she said she missed me, was glad i contacted her. then never really put an effort in to our friendship. she got engaged. asked me to be her maid of honor. i said yes, of course. regardless of how our current friendship was, those good days will always be remembered. she had to change her wedding from friends and family to just family because her friends weren't responding to rsvp. i, sorta regrettably but not really, lashed out at the bridal party saying that she wants us there on her special day.. we should be there 110%.. my trying to plan the stagette was a complete failure. a bunch of girls didn't show because they didn't like my attitude towards ""it shouldn't take you 3 months to rsvp to one night celebrating a friends once in a life time happy event..."". i removed all my little rants (they weren't mean. blunt, but not mean) upon the brides wishes. she told me she didn't want to hurt their feelings. even though they had crushed her. these girls told me i was childish (although, i think they were for calling me the names they did.. when i didn't specifically say mean things). 

so in any case. here i am. a few guy friends. who all have girlfriends or wives (which is great, i'm not after any of them), just meaning they're busy with their own lives. 
i go to work every day. i go home after work and watch tv. i play with my cat and eat dinner. i go to bed. i do this every day. on the weekends i often just lay in bed, watching shows. when my buddies are free, i go and hang out with them! always a good time.

but i feel such a lackluster on life right now. i can't even hold friends. my attitude and demeanor are obviously off. i know there's something about me that people don't like i just don't know what to change. i can't imagine dating someone because i'm not happy with myself. if i even started dating one, how/when would i tell them? i mean, from my daily routine, i'm not going to meet anyone anyways.. but like..

My love of science has had me research things that have no useful application in my life like physics, cosmology, anthropology, evolution, genetics, mathematics, politics, ethics, atheism, and technology.

Read, read, read, read.

The whole body of knowledge points to a cold and indifferent universe in which I am captive to the culture of a civilization with which I do not agree with. 

I feel like I woke up to the fact that everyone just does what they were told, indefinitely. Why? Am I crazy to see this? If not, do I even WANT to live in a world where I disagree with everything?

So many things are just WRONG in the world.

This happens in the context of my personal situation: 30; live at home with parents because they are underemployed/unemployed. They are really nice people but they are even more vulnerable than I am. They don't know much about the world other than they like to eat and go to church. They are as unprepared to deal with life as the son they brought into existence. They are everything to me and that is precisely the problem.

They and I have no money, no social connections, no inheritance, no extended family.

All of this has robbed me of any desire to do anything in this world.

I don't see how my situation will ever change. 

On top of that I think I fit somewhere in the Autism spectrum. Not only do I look like I'm 10 years younger, I have always had more affinity to 'things' and 'places' than people. Alternatively it may be my IQ is too high and I have a hard time relating to people. (before you laugh, I have an IQ of 146 per 12th yr high school).

I see everybody with their groups of friends, laughing, doing all kinds of cool things with their lives. And here I am...I am stuck in a computer science major, on my way to a 9 to 5 office job.


Recently, I attended a guest lecture by a sex education professor, and she made all kinds of jokes and told all kinds of stories about the sexual escapades that the typical college student goes through. And the audience was roaring with laughter, subtly bragging to everyone else around them like ""Yeah, that's me. I'm getting all kinds of sex, and having all kinds of fun.""


It was utterly depressing. Because I know that girls find me repulsive, and I am so socially inept that I cannot even hold a conversation with another human being for more than a few seconds. All of these wonderful, romanticized college experiences that everyone loves to boast about...I'll never have those experiences.

I also like to listen to all the music he used to love. Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra were among his favorites. Sometimes I'll put on Lady's Gaga's jazz album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek.

What I watch depends on what mood I'm in.

* Parks and Rec is great. The tone of the show is typically a lot more subtle than most sitcoms, and the character development is so good, the show just keeps getting better as you watch it (it's also very upbeat on the whole, if I'm really in a shitty mood it can do a lot to make me feel better).

The first season really isn't that great (the show was basically just a smalltown version of The Office for its first 6 episodes), and since not a lot goes on plot wise you can just skip it.

The show is charming, funny, and I can't emphasize how much the characters grow on you; this would be my top pick.

* Community is also great (though not for everyone, still worth trying out).

* Invader Zim if I just feel like ignoring everything. It's a kid's show, sure, but I enjoy it irregardless. (And it's on YouTube, so no cost!).

Still do, though not nearly as bad as before. 

IMHO: The thing about helping people with advice is this: 

a: if you've been there before, you've got perspective that they might really need. Perspective is one thing that people with depression and anxiety really, really lack while they are in it.

b: People in the throws of depression and/or anxiety are not thinking clearly. Just helping someone ride out an episode can be crucial. One of the most vital things a friend convinced me of: ""it will pass."" If he hadn't told me that, with authority, I don't know what I would have done. 

c: If you're willing to just listen, you can give someone who suffers a great deal of comfort. 

d: Those who haven't actually suffered depression can't know what it is like...and thus, they say things that cause those who suffer to feel even more isolated. You will hear that theme here a lot... people telling those who suffer, ""hey, just get over it."" That's the difference between the blues, and outright depression. Everyone's had the blues.

I'm 25, and I'm English but I live in Sydney, Australia. I've been here about 6 months, after having travelled in Asia for 3 months.

I've been quite lucky since I moved here, I got an apartment fairly quickly as well as a very well paid job in a great company. 

But none of it matters. I should feel like everything is great but it's not. I don't think I like Sydney, but that's not really the problem.

I don't drink anymore, and i was exercising fairly regularly until recently I couldn't even find the lustre to do that. Most weekends I have spent alone and in bed for the last few months. When I get home, I just want to close myself in my room and be alone. I distract myself with TV and reddit to avoid the pain of having to think about how empty I feel.

My job is fine, but I just can't concentrate. I keep thinking eventually I'll be found out to be completely useless. I just can't seem to achieve as high as I would like. It's not my passion, but I don't know if I have any passion. I don't feel passionate about anything. I recently ended things with my girlfriend, who i had travelled with, because I didn't feel in love with her and it wasn't fair on her. I just couldn't face lying with my back to her every night anymore feeling her sad eyes behind me. This adds to how terrible i feel... she was in love with me and I couldn't reciprocate that.

My best friends and family are on the other side of the world, and even talking to them doesn't really help. The truth is, I don't know what I want. I think maybe I've clicked log off from the bullshit of everyday urban life, and maybe I just want to be free again, roaming countries with a backpack on my back. But then, I don't know if that would fix this problem of sheer emptiness and lack of desire for anything.

I'm also useless with personal finances, and have not managed to save a penny since I've been here and managed get into more debt. This makes me feel trapped, and perhaps this is adding to my woe somewhat?

I guess my question is - am I just suffering a lack of self confidence and idleness and should get my act together and appreciate the good things in my life or am I actually depressed and need help to process whatever the fuck is going in my head?

I feel like I am just moaning when I should just get my act together and grab my life and make it good.

I just want to know the results of my T3, T4, and TSH tests. I'm tired of taking the meds given to me because I feel like they're really not doing their job and I'm just tired of going through the side-effects and waiting for them to ""start working"". I'm just tired of all the reassurance I get about meds because when it doesn't work, it just ends up being nothing but a huge disappointment. And then you're gonna be put on another med and all that. Anyways, I haven't been taking my meds for a while now. I don't feel like I need them, and really, I don't think I need them. My problem here isn't getting out of bed or anything, it's feeling numb. Emotionally numb and I just can't find any enjoyment in anything.

I've been given the papers to get tested for well over a month now. In fact, I was supposed to get it tested before my last appointment but I lagged it to just after my last appointment. It's been a long wait... and I'm hoping something bad shows up on the test so I know it's something I could probably try to fix.

I don't know. This whole month I've been trying to fiddle with nootropics and such. I haven't taken a single med, Wellbutrin, Abilify, nor Inderal. Abilify was my new med to take... Inderal wasn't new but I haven't even taken one of that either.

I was pretty done with 'em. I was on the max dose of Wellbutrin before telling myself I didn't want to be on them no more. It made me sweaty, nauseous, and also have no appetite. I no longer feel much of those anymore at all. The sweaty part only comes when I'm working out or something, doing something that'd normally make me sweat. I did workout while on Wellbutrin before and it would make me sweat like crazy after just warming up.

So my appointment is this Friday. I don't really know what to tell my psychiatrist. All I just want him to know is that I no longer want to be on the meds, and haven't been taking my meds. And I don't give a shit if he thinks that's not the way to go. I even suggested getting off meds and he just shook his head and was like ""That's not gonna work.""  Yeah, it might just take months or years to ""find the right med"". Taking meds are totally gonna work when you find out that it's trial and error. I don't want to take meds for now, is it that hard for a psychiatrist to listen to that?

Wondering if I could just not make the next appointment if he refuses to take me off meds or something. I'm seriously considering switching or not seeing a psychiatrist/therapist for a while... I'm not really looking forward to seeing him other than to get my test results. I want a psychiatrist who'd just listen if I were to ask for alternative treatments or blood tests for vitamin/mineral deficiency.

Really though, what's with some psychiatrists just being pill pushers? I was given Ritalin for my ""diagnosis"" of ADD. Didn't even think I had ADD. Now Ritalin, I'm fine with. Then comes Prozac for my ""anxiety"" which I keep constantly telling my psychiatrist that I don't feel anxious very often and if I did, it's probably from the depression. Wellbutrin ""to help me quit smoking marijuana"" and perhaps depression... Yeah. Inderal was given for ""anxiety"", when I told him I sweat a lot from Wellbutrin. Nope... don't wanna take them if I don't need them and taking them for a side-effect of something else just makes a lot more side-effects come up. And Abilify? Didn't try.

Don't get me wrong. Meds do work for some people. For someone like me, I don't think I need meds to get by... I'm just looking for something that'd make me feel like living again. I can get out of bed, go to work, go to school, but my mind is fogged up and I can't enjoy shit. I don't need the meds to help me with that. In fact, I don't think the meds even did much for that... so why keep taking them when they just end up making me feel worse when I can't eat and when I do, I just feel like puking?",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,It's been a long month waiting to see my psychiatrist,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jhm3a/its_been_a_long_month_waiting_to_see_my/,

A bit about myself! I'm 19 years old and female, 20 in November. I'm going into my 2nd year of Uni doing a teaching degree in 2 weeks that will leave me qualified to teach English in 2016. I have a lovely boyfriend who I have been with for 7 years, My first year of Uni finished in April, meaning I have had 5 months of doing hardly anything, my auntie had a baby in July so I've been helping her out a bit.. other than that I take my boyfriend to work mon-fri at 9am, wait for him to finish work at 5pm then pick him up, rinse and repeat until the weekend.

But what I've learned is that you cannot go out and ""force"" yourself to be more social, it's when I try hard to be friends with people that I end up feeling even more alone. It sounds cliche but just be yourself. Go to school. Keep yourself busy and in time you will not be alone anymore. Do what you love and people will see you for who you are. Keep your chin up :)

Then I met some more great people and introduced them to him, and we became a sort of group on the internet that talked. We had great, meaningful conversations and they helped me through a lot of problems I was having back then. Recently, the original guy decided that I wasn't worth his effort and he removed me, after sending a fairly hateful message. I'm not gonna go into detail, but he basically said a lot of rude, hurtful and mostly untrue things, such as calling me a fag, douchebag and terrible friend. I would agree with the terrible friend part, since I seem to manage to ruin most relationships with friends that I get. After that, he started complaining to our mutual friends about how much of a jerk I am, and got them to ditch me for him by saying ""remove one of us or the other"". They came to me about this and I told them to remove me so they don't lose him as a friend, since I knew that great friends deserved better than me. So they did. I have lost all 4 friends excluding the original. Then I lost a friend I knew in real life because of some stupid crap that would have been so easy to get over if he had just talked to me. Lately they have been making my life hell by sending me messages and inviting me to chats. I blocked them, and they made new accounts and did the same thing. Eventually I deleted the account, but I cannot get over this empty feeling and the hurt I got from that experience. Recently, I met a new person on the internet who seemed like a great person, but I didn't want to commit myself to a friendship that would end like the others, so I was careful and eased into it. After a few great months of chatting and playing games, he said a lot of crap to me and eventually removed all of my stuff (phone number, facebook, chat stuff, etc. ) and is out of my life. Then one of my old friends comes back and says I need to help because the original friend is threatening to kill himself unless I come talk to him. This hit me hard, because I have a depression problem and have attempted suicide before, when I was younger. So I talked to him and he mocked me about when I tried to kill myself (he was one of the few I told) and made all the feelings I felt when he originally left. Now, I am an emotional wreck and find that the slightest things will shake me so much more than before. I have no idea what to do, and I have no idea how to fix my life. I currently have an amazing girlfriend who deserves so much better, but she cannot help me at all because she doesn't know how to fix it and it upsets her when I bring up how I'm feeling (she always feels more sad and tries to help, and I just don't want to make her more depressed for reasons I won't post here). She has enough on her plate without my problems, I'll wait until I can help her with her issues before I ask her for help. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder after this by a psychiatrist. After all this, one of the friends from the group comes back and says he wants me back in his life. I agree, because I have nobody else and start talking to him, but it isn't like it was before and it's more of a husk of what we used to have. Besides my girlfriend and him, all I have are a few casual friends from work and school that don't really know anything about me except what I do and my name. If you have any suggestions on how to get over this, I would greatly appreciate some help, because I'm running close to the end of my rope.
For those who will suggest therapy, I've tried it and it didn't help me. It actually added onto my anxiousness. I've been through 4 therapists who juggled my file and have not gotten much done. I'm not on any prescribed medication, nor am I self medicating or doing any kind of drugs whatsoever.  
NOTE: I am in no danger of suicide, just want some help.

I recently started taking SSRI's for depression and although they help moderately, they have caused more problems for me than I can name. A BIG one is that I feel disconnected from reality, although I am not as 'sad' I find myself not being able to really express myself, cry, orgasm, you name it. Especially rough since I have recently started dating a guy that I really like. 

It's hard when you have spent your whole life building up that wall to protect yourself from other people, I mean, you hate yourself enough you don't need others adding to that pain. I know exactly what that's like. You are NOT weak for feeling like this. If anything you are stronger than most people could ever dream of being. It takes perseverance and strength just to carry on with 'normal life' when you have depression, not to mention to the extent you have described. 

Honestly, you are lucky to have someone close to you who knows a bit of what you are going through, and you should definitely confide in each  other. I used to date a guy with depression, and we played off of each other pretty nicely. After  I started my meds and got my false sense of hope going, I dumped him for the guy I am seeing now. I  wasn't  exactly a great move for my depression. Now I just feel like I burden everyone I try to  confide in about my problems. 

Bottom line, you are NOT alone. More people know how you are feeling more than you could imagine. A lot of them are people you might never even suspect. Don't be afraid to reach out.

Lemme say that I am a long time lurker to this sub, and honestly knowing that there are other people out there like me is comforting in a way, and I thank you all for sharing your stories here, any how here goes nothing.

I've dealt with issues pertaining to depression and social anxiety since my early teens, roughly half of my existence, but some how always managed a way to cope. I sometimes think of life as a role in a movie, it's just a matter of putting on a different mask for a different situation, and if that's the case I'm pretty good at it. It's kinda funny how people have always seen me as sort of a good listener, even though most of the time I'm just staring blankly and reacting accordingly to their tone/expressions. But it's exhausting, and over time I've managed to systematically eliminate any friends, have a barely functional relationship with my family, and lack the resources to seek any kind of counseling (not to mention my overall distrust of opening up to total strangers that I'd be hypothetically paying to listen to me and keep confidential). 

Now I consider myself to be a very rational person, I think things through, even occasionally make pros and cons charts. However for the life of me I can't come up with any logical reason to continue going day to day like this. I literally wake up, watch tv, go to what ever dead end job I'm currently at, come home sit for a while and sleep, which is the best part because to me sleep translates to the end of another day, and if I'm lucky enough the prospect of not waking up in the morning. What's frustrating is that I've really tried, especially the last couple of years. I've lost a lot of weight, quit drinking, even began dating again,but it doesn't matter I'm just tired of it, this constant fucking weight pushing on me every single day. I really wish I wasn't such a damn coward, really I do. Every thing people say or is written says that suicide is an easy out, I disagree I think it take someone with tremendous strength to determine how their life ends. For instance, I have the motive, the means, and the prerequisite note mixed in somewhere in my journals ready to go, but I'm terrified by the prospect of failure. I failed at nearly everything I've every tried in my life, and the idea of failing to end it is petrifying. Not to mention the shame and stigma associated with having to continue living with that.

Any way I think that's all I got for now, if you managed to read this all this I appreciate it, seriously I do. This was never about me wanting attention or some kind of misguided cry for help, just merely a form of self expression I suppose, just me looking for an outlet for what I have goin on in my head.

Tangent:  there was a nice thread on reddit last week that asked ""What are you proud of?""  I didn't comment but the thing that came to mind was that I can pick myself up no matter what happens to me.  For the first five years of my depression,  I couldn't do that because depression was just the norm and I didn't even realize that is was  something one could fight.  The next five years,  I would try to pick myself up and often fall down.  The ladder analogy is a really good one, by the way.

The last couple years of depression was when I really started fighting and researching,  and I learned a bunch of different ways to keep getting up. 

Every time you rebuild your defenses,  you are strengthening that metaphoric muscles that helps you deal with things.  Your work has not been a farce;  it's been a workout.  It sounds to me like cooking your own meals could be a corner stone to you staying ahead of your own depression.  Keep frozen ingredients around so they are always there when you are in the mood to cook.  Play music you love while you cook  and congratulate yourself with each bite of the meal.

Your anxiety sounds kind of serious; are you on any medication to deal with that?

2) What is a completed dissertation / PhD actually going to do for you? I have one too. Right now it is worth less than one of the ear cleaning pads I just used on my dog. Degrees are not magical solutions to problems, nor do they guarantee employment. 

3) If you are THAT close to finishing, maybe it's worth it to finish simply to be able to close this chapter on your life. That's basically the path I took. I knew I wouldn't stay in academia after graduation and it took a couple of months after finishing to figure out what my new path would be. But I have a bulldog personality and couldn't walk away without the degree, no matter how painfully it had to be acquired. 

4) BALANCE IS KEY. The quality of your academic work is not a reflection of your worth as a human being. If creative writing makes you happy, do it for an hour a day to relax.

I'm younger than her so it's harder for me to understand but I do know she can get advice and help from the university she wants to go to and other places. Obviously this has affected her for a while because we haven't sexted for 4 months at all (we did it a few times a week), she hasn't responded to affection in ages and honestly it all makes me feel like it's my fault and it really drags me down with her. She keeps telling me she's doomed to live and die alone and that she'll never have anyone there for her like I don't even exist, then I tell her I'm always here for her and she doesn't respond to me. Really, she just doesn't let me in and help her.  My friends just tell me to leave her but firstly I can't do that considering it would just make her worse (and I still know I can do something to help her), and secondly I love her way too much to do that, but then again it's hard for me to see that she loves me when she's like this.

Observing and understantding is something I had to learn. I want to be here for her, as much as she is here for me. It is just not instinctive and has to be a conscious effort. Over time it gets easier and more automatic.

The irony is that in our couple, I am the one with depression and PTSD, and she is the understanding shoulder I can lean on.

Also, his remark about having sex is not him being a dick (ha!). I don't know if it's a man thing, but sex does make me feel better (although you're right, depressions is a very poor aphrodisiac).

I think that what you need is to make it clear that you are not feeling well and that it really bothers you, and explain that you need some comfort. He is probably not able to see it the way it is, especially if he has never experienced depression himself.

People who say ""be yourself"" don't really understand the pressures and influences we face. ""Be the most excellent version of yourself"" should be the better motto. If you have areas you struggle with, strengthen them. And the areas you excel at, showcase to the world.

I can now say that I am beginning to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel though and the only reason I am, is because I actually did ask for help.  It was one of the hardest things to do, because like you, I didnt think anyone cared, could help, and I definitely didnt want to let anyone down.  But there came a point where I was scared I would hurt myself, so I confided in one person.  That was the BEST thing I ever did.  I then started seeing a professional psychotherapist and it has helped IMMENSELY!  After all, they are trained professionals.  In fact, their profession exists becuase there are people like you, and me and all the people on this blog and millions of more whose life experiences have led them to have thoughts that lead to feelings that end messing us up.  So YOU ARE NOT ALONE in that sense.  I can completely understand how you feel alone in your world though, at home or at school and I am so sorry about your dog (RIP).  But have faith that this will not go on forever.  Life is everchanging, nothing will ever stay the same, but ONLY YOU can instigate the change.  You have to be brave enough to take that first step.  Confide in someone or even one of those anonymous organisations, like the Samaritans. No one has to know who you are, and no one has to find out, but they can refer you to someone who can.

i know this to be true because i was like you when i first came to college. i didn't have very many friends either. most of my friends from that time haven't stuck since i never fit in with them to begin with. looking back, it was pretty much a waste of a year.


it's a shame since i now realize that things could have been so much better if i had just met the right people back then. at the same time, however, i realize now that i didn't try hard enough. i was lucky enough to find a great group of friends the next year, but that's only because i persisted in looking. those thoughts that all of college would be equally dreary went away pretty quickly.


obviously given that i'm on this sub things aren't going perfect for me, but that's in no way due to my friends. they are the best thing that has happened to me. i highly recommend to keep looking out, but only in the places where you think your ""type"" of people would be at. it's pointless to go to a party to make new friends if the party lifestyle isn't for you. in your classes, talk to your neighbors, go to office hours, help people with homework. everyone there shares something in common with you and that's the course you're taking. start talking about that and see where the conversation takes you. especially in freshmen year, people should still be receptive to letting new people in their groups.

Speaking from personal experience however, I have noticed I do feel the same. I am always checking myself in the mirror, looking at my weight (I'm about 103 kg [last time I checked] at 6,1"" - Pretty healthy) - however I'm losing weight, in the last two weeks I've gone down a notch in my belt.

I do however have a cleft lip which also affects my nose slightly. I've often felt that's been a hindrance despite coming to terms with it and have such a wide circle of friends and being paid multiple complements on occasion. My love life hasn't been sparse, but I also haven't helped it myself which has nothing to do with my appearance. Still, given that I was bullied for it in school and in college before coming to university I felt it could be improved. Well I finally am getting something done about it, on the 17th I am having surgery to improve it further.

It may turn out worse or it may be one of the best things I've ever wanted. Either way I will have to live with the consequences, but it's a risk I'm willing to take, because I'm using that fear of not being good enough or falling back into a pit of others looking at me as if I'm some 'case' to motivate me to do something about it. It's been a little voice whenever I look in the mirror and it does drive me crazy.

But growing up with something like this has taught me that even though I may feel like this sometimes, those times when I laugh with my friends, go to watch a film, share an Indian with my house mates or have a catch up with friends I can still have a normal life, a normal set of feelings that I share with people I thought were normal. No one is normal, everyone has their scars, their cleft lips, their acne, their mucky beards, etc... some show, some don't. But eventually everyone spots it and it doesn't matter because we're too focused on having a good time. You kind of have to let yourself.

   I just found out that a close ex of mine's (we broke up because I went overseas for a while) life is sort of falling apart, and she's attempted suicide once already, a month or two ago. Her boyfriend, who was her rock while getting through school, just turned on her and had apparently been lying about basically everything the whole time. Now, she feels alone and worthless, and probably the worst thing about it all is that she feels in much higher amplitudes than most people.
   I'm bogged down with a maxed out courseload in engineering school, pledging a fraternity, and have a girlfriend of my own, so I really don't have much time to spend with her. I talk to her occasionally, though, but I fear not enough to impact her life as much as she needs to.
   What would y'all suggest I do? I love this girl, and it would kill me to see her take her own life, but I wouldn't have enough time to majorly intervene if there were 30 hours in a day. Should I make her go to counselling, or just change her life radically, or what? I'm at a loss for what to do, and I'm just looking for suggestions.

37631,,True,[deleted],,,,"It actually applies, when you think about it. Now, when I say ""you need to love yourself"", that doesn't mean you just need to magically become happy. Loving yourself means putting forth the effort, no matter what the stakes, to become ""happy"" or at least content; To allow outsiders to come in. I've lived most of my life with the mindset of ""I don't deserve love, nobody understands, I hate myself."", but if you just change the direction of thought, everything can change. First off, you have to tell people. Tell them why their advice doesn't make sense, tell them everything you think you need to get better, answer their questions about your problems. You cannot expect somebody to love you if you don't let them in. Finding the strength to open up; THAT is loving yourself. The more you ignore the causes of your problems and focus on the impact of the problems, the more miserable you're going to be. the more you'll ""hate"" yourself. Sometimes you just have to realize ""hey, I'm a pretty decent human. I deserve happiness and I'm going to get it."" I didn't realize real love until I let my girlfriend in. I always told myself ""she doesn't understand, how could she?"" But the more I revealed to her, the more she understood. The more she had to work with. I'm sorry for the redundancy and lack of organization, sort of just spilled everything out.

Sorry, boring read ensured.

For the past 8 or so months, I've been depressed to the extent that, somedays, picking myself up off the floor has been a chore. Also had social anxiety, panic attacks, hyperventilation, general loss of health; the works. Nevertheless, seem to be getting better bar a few things. 

Its really hard to talk to others (about anything, even about myself), but I don't think its a communication issue (or anxiety), just that nothing comes out. This gets worse when I get tired.

I always fall into one of the following patterns:

* I don't know enough about, or have no opinion on, the subject matter, so end up going quiet and let others talk it out.
* I try too hard to force myself to talk, that crap comes out; incoherent or not.
* I let the other person do all the talking and can only give a  superficial responce (e.g. ""hey that's cool"", ""really? thats awesome"", ""way to go!"", etc..)
* The conversation changes too fast that the time I have something to say, everyone is on another topic.

I don't know, I have always been quiet, introverted, perhaps a little slow and have a poor vocabulary. But never really felt like this before. Anyone else experienced similar, or have any idea what to do to improve?

Even though I am a year away from graduating, I find it extremely hard to stay motivated and do well in my classes. I used to love writing and now I can't even sit down and come up with something creative and passionate like I used to. My only real hobbies are video games and guitar. Like many here, my social life is basically non-existent. I had a close circle of friends in high school, but we all went to different schools after that and I guess I never found my social niche in college.

I also had a steady girlfriend of 5 years throughout high school and the beginning of college. We broke up a little over 2 years ago and I still have tons of anxiety about it. We had a lot of great times together but she was very insecure and suffered from anxiety/depression herself. She didn't tell me this at the time and things ended very badly. I don't really know whose fault it was that we broke up or what I could have done better or differently. I wonder these things all the time though and constantly beat myself up about it. The break-up was definitely a catalyst for my depression. She recently entered back in to my life and I'm not really sure where things are headed, we almost got married and I think I still want/miss that. But... it would take a lot of grace and forgiveness from both of us. She was the first to fool around with someone else after we broke up. She was the first to find another meaningful relationship (I haven't). For all intents and purposes, she ""won"" the break-up... but what she could not see was that I was never trying to ""win"" in the first place, I never wanted to break up and I just wanted her to be happy. I can't even open myself up to other meaningful relationships with other women now out of fear that I will get too attached and one day watch them walk out of my life for no good reason at all.

I do have a few good things going for me right now. I'm blessed to have a supportive family, an education, and a job waiting for me when I'm done with school. I've recently kicked a daily porn/fapping habit through the help of [r/NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/). I started smoking weed a few years ago for insomnia, and I want to kick that habit too, but I also can't afford to have trouble sleeping right now while I'm at such a low.

How do you deal with motivating yourself in the present when you're stuck thinking about the past and filled with irrational regrets and sadness?

1.) Call your mother's doctor.  Tell her about your mother's pain medication because she may not be aware of it.  Also tell your mother's doctor about the side-effects of the Klonopin/Clonazepam.  The doctor probably won't talk to you about the particulars of your mother's illness, but she *will* listen to you.  

Sometimes, when people are put on medicines to control mental illness, the medicine does a great job.  Sometimes, when people are put on medicines to control mental illness, the first medicine doesn't do so great.  The doctor and your mum need to work together to find the right medication at the right dosage.  It's possible the Clonazepam has been prescribed at too great a dosage.  It's possible your mum is abusing the medication.  Talk to the doctor about fine-tuning the medication.  He or she should also take care to make sure the medication isn't being abused. (Without knowing all of the details, I wonder if your mother would be better served with an SSRI instead of a benzoid, especially in light of her back situation.  I wonder why the doctor made the decision she did.)

Also, don't be afraid to change doctors if you don't feel that you're getting appropriate treatment.  

Oh, and when you speak with the doctor, take notes EVERY time.  Date it and record the time.

2.) Talk to your mom.  Tell her how much you love and care for her.  Tell her how scared you are.  Ask if you could make your mom a new doctor's appointment because you think she's having a reaction to the medicine.  Then, accompany your mom on her next doctor's appointment.

Sometimes people are so blinded by their own problems, that they don't realize the person that they come to for advice could use some advice themselves.  Please don't take offense that I said 'blinded by their own problems' I did not mean anything bad, it's just the simplest way I can think to phrase it.  People have the hardest time seeing things that are right in front of them, on a subconscious ( or maybe conscious) level their brain ignores it.  Don't see it as them ignoring you.  I'm sorry you are the one everyone comes to for their problems and you have to remain supportive (by the way, this makes you an amazing friend) while no one is showing you any support.
I completely understand that it is demoralizing (in your words) being knocked down over and over again, but try seeing it as you continually pull yourself back up over and over.  You have every right to feel the way you do, and no one should diminish the way you feel claiming that 'they have it worse' (random, but thought I should include that).
Try keeping a journal that you can vent in - writing is very therapeutic, and you can say things in a journal that you cannot say to someone face-to-face.  Listen to music, watch a movie, write, do whatever you can to give yourself a method of venting - post comments here, no one is going to judge you.

It was a special treat as I was due to be leaving to head back to university that Sunday. The film itself was really beautiful and is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, but it also helped me to realise what I am doing with my life.

I feel this requires a bit of backstory, so I shall start about 6 months ago in the lead up to my final set of A-level exams. Everything was going great, I’d already got an unconditional offer to the university I wanted to study at so I didn’t really need to do these exams at all other than to complete my A-Levels. I still wanted to do well though and so in the Easter holiday I worked as hard as I could. Then at the beginning of the second week I woke up to hear my Mom on the phone. I can always tell when there’s something not right. There’s a certain way that she talks, loud and slow as if to try and calm the person on the other end of the phone.

My Grandmother had been taken to hospital, it didn’t sound too serious though. A bladder infection, nothing more. After a day of panic it seemed that everything was going to be alright, she would come out of the hospital and have to take some drugs to stop it from happening again. Then the test results came back. 

It was cancer. Of course it was, what else could it have been. 

My Nan had lost her legs years ago due to blood clots in the arteries. She was on a large number of pills just to counteract the side-effects of the pills that she needed. Along with this she had somehow managed to break what was left of both her legs as well as her pelvis. This lead to her sitting upright all the time, causing discomfort.

All of this disguised the symptoms of the cancer that was spreading through her body.

They didn’t bother looking for the initial source. There wasn’t much point. Within a month she had gone.

I compared the whole thing to trying to swim through a cheesecake. The solid custardy layer is filled with air-holes and so every-so-often I would find a period which would allow me to move more freely. Eventually I reached the strawberry jam that was on the top, allowing me to see where I was heading more clearly. Sure I hit a few pieces of fruit along the way, but I knew what was waiting for me after I got out.

And for the 10 weeks before I left for uni, I was free.

For a few weeks after I arrived at university I felt happy. I had finally completed my quest. It had taken me an extra year to get here due to some poor choices, but I had made it.

I made new friends, learnt new things and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have even found someone for the first time in my life who I love.

And that’s where the problems begin again. I can’t bring myself to tell her. I’m 19 and have no previous experience in any of this. Along with that I’m frightened of what her response may be.
Another problem I have is that everyone seems to know more than I do about the subject I’m supposed to be studying. I’m starting to feel as though I shouldn’t be here. I feel like my education up to this point hasn’t prepared me enough.

And now back to our feature film. For those who haven’t seen it, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is about a man called Walter. Walter day-dreams a lot. He just goes totally blank and pictures himself doing things that he would never be able to do in real life. The one person that this is all centred around is his co-worker Cheryl. Eventually situations arise that allow him to go and explore the world, to skateboard down Eyjafjallajökull and to climb far off mountains.

I realised throughout the film that Walter is me. I want to go and explore. To find out what the rest of the world is like. And most of all, I want to get the girl. I imagine all of these beautiful scenes that would solve all my problems, but never have the confidence to act them out.

And so, two days before my first set of exams, I find myself in this horrendous depression. I’ve spent the last week shut off from the world in my bedroom, unable to focus on the revision that I really should be doing. Starting to go mad from the loneliness. Craving any form of human contact I can get. Fire alarms at 2:40am also haven’t helped.

Many thoughts have run through my mind. What if she isn’t the one? If she isn’t the one, who is? What if I don’t meet the right person?

I have accepted that I am not going to be able to pass these exams, but I don’t want to have to go home. It’s not that I hate my family, but after living away from home for three months I am starting to find them annoying. My sisters particularly, but then they were annoying before I left home. 

There’s also the fact that I have already signed up to live with my friends next year and paid the deposit on the property we would rent. If I fail my course I will be leaving them with a massive problem because they will have to fill the room that I have left behind. If I fail, I’ll also be leaving them behind. Something I don’t want to have to do because I have never felt more accepted than with them. I also can’t afford to go out and do the big things that I want to do, such as travel as I don’t know how much money I’m going to have and how much of that will be taken back if I have to leave.

I haven’t talked to anyone about this outside my own family. The way that they have been treating me suggests that they think it will all go away if I just work hard. The problem is that I can’t work hard. There’s too much going on for me to be able to concentrate.

I haven’t been to see a doctor about it because I’m scared to. I’ve never been confident with talking to people over the phone and I don’t want to end up being put on a medication that ends up controlling my life. I feel powerless right now enough with worries about money and the voice of my parents in my head saying “No, don’t be stupid. You can’t buy this because it’ll stop you from working even more.” The last thing I want is to have even more control taken away from me.

195118,,True,Octoquat,,,,"You're not worthless. You care enough about yourself to post for help, so you haven't given up on yourself. The fact that you posted this, seeking help, means that even the tiniest sliver of your mind is clinging to the idea that there is a solution. That underdog sliver of your mind will win. You know in the back of your mind that you will find a job if you just apply to enough businesses, but the effort of doing so is absolutely crushing to think about. It's okay to feel like that. I felt like that too, and I still think I'm going to be fired from my job on a daily basis. As far as I know, there isn't a magical solution to this, but being okay with being scared to try something new, like a job, is a normal part of life that EVERYONE goes through. You're not alone, we're all pretty much all scared shitless about the future.


But when you do get your job, whatever it is, just take it. Work anywhere. You're working at a fast food joint. You think you're going to fuck up an order because you're new and don't know how the computer works, you're pressed for time, you're worried that your manager will think you're slow and incompetent because that's what you think of yourself. You're not slow, you're not incompetent. You're new. EVERYONE has fucked up at a new job sometimes 15 times before it becomes a routine to do it correctly. Instead of criticizing yourself when you screw up (because you will, a lot) try to critique yourself instead. Remember the times you mess up and imagine yourself instead doing those tasks quickly and efficiently. You don't have to plan out every step of the way, but actively noting points in order to learn from a mistake vs. blinding yourself with self hatred will really help out a lot. Pretend that this job is the most important job in the world. If you treat your job like it's the most important thing in the world, you'll be a great employee, the managers will see you as an asset to the company, and you'll be able to take pride in your work, regardless of what it is. It'll make you take pride in yourself, and you'll feel a lot less worthless. People will depend on you, and you'll be able to handle it because you're now one of the experienced staff members who put his whole heart into his work. 

Apply for at least 3 jobs in your area tomorrow. If it's a restaurant, go in M-Th from 1-3 pm. A manager will probably be able to speak to your directly, and you'll have like a 60% bump in the probability that you'll get hired. Be nice and respectful to whomever you talk to at each business. You might walk out, and the manager will say to the pimply 15 year old cashier, ""What do you think?"" Even though this kid has no pull in the company whatsoever, him saying, ""I liked him, he was really polite to me"" will go a LONG way for you. My managers have asked what I think of applicants every single time I've handed someone an application. 

You can do this. I spent 5 months laying bed, every morning saying 'today I will apply for a job' and it never happened. Then one day the stars aligned, I got lucky, and landed a job. I can't guarantee anything for you, honestly, but I can guarantee that doing nothing will make you feel worse, because doing nothing made me feel shittier every day. At least apply, and you'll feel good about yourself.

If you want, PM your (very) general location and I'll look around for postings online to help you out. 

Edit: More job tips that I just thought of, always be the one who is willing to learn. Say ""can you teach me how to do this?"" instead of ""can you do this for me?"". Also, if you don't have experience in a particular industry, my go to is ALWAYS to say something like 'well I know I don't have much experience in this particular field, but I excelled at my previous job, which was -whatever it was- and I'm eager to learn how to apply my skills from my previous job to this one'. Don't be afraid to tell them you were/are really good at something.

I just felt this needed context.

I'm 31. In high school I had a pretty tough time. My dad left our family when I started highschool when I was about 12 or 13. Before he did he made us move house to an area which I hated. I was really sporty and active and that was how I managed to deal with a lot of my emotions. Then one day I noticed my neighbour stalking me in his car while I was out jogging, so I stopped going outside because I was scared. It was like I was trapped in my own house. I met a guy on the internet who lied to me about having cancer to get me to sleep with him when I was 14. I got so depressed I stopped talking to everyone, especially my family who I would just get mad at and yell at. I had acquaintances but only one real friend, and she was always there for me. She used to go to the school counsellor with me. When I told her how I wanted to kill myself she wrote a page on why I shouldn't. I remember being so mad at her for trying to stop me, but she was a loving friend. She was going through her own depression and cutting herself as well, so we were going through so much together.

We fell out of touch after school because we had a disagreement. She wanted to move cities and I didn't want her to. Not so she could be there for me, I was just worried about her. She ended up getting on a train with just $100 in her pocket. I emailed her after to see how she was but didn't get a response. I heard she had been living with strangers and taking drugs, and it was hard to hear, but I heard she got her life back on track and I was happy for her. 

She spent her adult life becoming a psychologist and was currently in training to be a clinical psychologist. She spent her weekends on a suicide phone help line, talking to people about what bothered them, and generally being an amazing caring person.

About a year and a half ago I messaged her on facebook and she replied and she was saying how she was moving cities again. She invited me to her farewell. I was really tired that night and didn't go, but I said I wanted to catch up again.

So much happened last year, mainly I had a wedding and it was a lot of work to plan. I didn't invite her because we'd been out of touch for so long. I never did get to catch up again, but I wasn't lying when I said I wanted to. When I thought back I thought it was just a couple of months ago like maybe 5 months, but when I realised it was so long I was so mad at myself. I feel like I've been so selfish and not thought about others enough. Life got busy but it shouldn't ever get that busy.

Right now I am so mad at myself for not being there for her. Especially as she was always there for me. We are both half asians and had difficulties with our asian fathers because they always had more important things in life. Her dad left her family as well. 

I have tried to reason and understand why she did it. I am so devastated. When I was at her funeral yesterday I was trying hard not to cry but as soon as I saw her coffin I choked. I felt immediately sick and I couldn't stop crying. I think of her lifeless body laying in the coffin and wish she was there with me instead. It was so hard to sit through the funeral. The whole time I was in tears. I wanted to leave, because I felt so horribly awful but I couldn't obviously out of respect. I feel like throwing up all the time and I feel like I am choking on every breath I take. I didn't feel like this when I first found out. It sort of just became real yesterday. 

I just feel so guilty that I wasn't the friend I should have been. Since leaving school the depression hasn't stop. I've gotten help from psychologists to help me deal with it. It hasn't been easy. It's affected every aspect of my life. I sometimes still think about suicide, but I don't think I would follow through like I used to feel as though I would. I always felt like I don't have the strength to live but I don't have the strength to end it either. That thought makes me feel even worse, like I'm some sort of coward who just lives in limbo. 

It feels like I'm a horrible person, and I have so much guilt. I have started getting angry about everything. I feel so unsettled all the time and I know yelling and crying isn't the best way to deal with it but I just don't know how else to let this out... and it's coming out whether I want it to or not. I'm supposed to be an adult by now, and I feel like a small child with no tools for dealing with my problems. ",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,My best friend from high school committed suicide.

He owns his own business where he makes less per year than my disabled mother who lives off of social security money. He was in jail for half my life, leaving my mother with multiple sclerosis alone to raise three kids. It goes without saying that my childhood was pretty harsh. Always threatened by homelessness and never knowing how long it would be before we could shop for groceries again. This is probably why I have a multitude of mental health issues.

I responded to his email by packing a bag of clothes and driving over to my mom's to stay the week while I clear my head of things. My plan was to come back Friday in a more optimistic mood and discuss things with my father and stepmom.

He was not happy about this. I got this email from him about an hour ago (copy and pasted):

""Apparently you're living elsewhere.

If this is in fact your response, please have your things out of here by
midnight tonight. The car is currently unlicensed and after midnight
tonight it will also be uninsured. This is written notification that you
will not have my permission to drive it and that I absolve all
responsibility for it. The gas credit card will also be cancelled at
midnight tonight as will the cell phone service. Please leave the car
parked in the back lot and return the key. You can keep the card and phone.

If you are NOT living elsewhere, I expect you home by midnight tonight
where we will be ready to discuss our continued expectations of you while
you are living here.""

I come to you, Reddit, in a time of desperate need. This dirty move my father has played on me is going to make living with him ten times more uncomfortable than it already was. Obviously there's a lot to this story that I can't explain but my main questions are this:

1) what the fuck should my next steps be to ensure I never have to look this piece of shit in the eyes ever again? Obviously I can't get a job without a car or a phone, both of which he's threatening to take from me. So continuing to ignore him is not an option.

2) what things can I do to improve my mental standing without the help of anyone else? Obviously my biggest handicap here is my depression / anxiety which is currently making it difficult to find a job. What are small steps I can take to overcome this cognitive barrier and move on with my life instead of letting it bring me down even more?

3) how can I tolerate living in the same house as someone as cold and toxic as my father without it driving me to breaking point?

Recently, in the past 2-3 years of so  I feel like my mind itself has grown greatly.
 Not just in retaining knowledge, but I am talking more about how my thought processes have matured. As a kid you look at life in sort of a first-person way, where there are other people, but you mostly see them in the context of yourself. Like how does this person make me feel(?), how is he/she influencing me(?). 

But I think as I have reached the age where I am now (23) I have realized that I am just merely one single human being in a planet inhabited by billions of other humans who have their own set of problems, thoughts, accomplishments, goals, etc. And we are all headed towards death.
I find the concept of death liberating in a way, like it is something that is inevetible for all of us, so why not make most of what we have right now?

But this is where I think my depression also derives from... the universe is so random and out of control and there are so many variables to everyday life that are out of our control, that it seems we're not in control at all. 
I find myself sometimes slipping away and lost, like why am I in a better position than someone else? Why is a certain person in a better position than me? What sets us apart?? 
I have goals I try and focus on and otherwise I am doing relatively fine in life compared to a lot of others, but sometimes it is hard to put into words the exact thoughts. 
Yes life is beautiful... but it is also empty and void and utterly random. We're not in control and we are so small, that sometimes I just lose focus and just not want to do anything. 

I think these thoughts have also made me develop a sense of anxiety in a way, where I calculate the negative outcome of something and can't help it. 
I guess the fact that everything is so out of control in everyday situations gives me a sense of depression, even though any person can control aspects of their life, truth is we're not in control at all.
Also there is no right or wrong imo, I just don't think there is ever just a ""right"" way of looking at the world.
If something is right for someone else, does it mean it necessarily right for another?
How is it one person born under great circumstances ended up in a not-so-good place, and someone not as privileged ended up successful?
What variables define success? None do, some increase our chances for sure, but everything is still extraordinarily out of our control.
Almost every single aspect of our personality and physical appearance is finalized before we are even born due to our genetic disposition, right down to intellect. 

I guess I am having a hard time properly writing down just how all of this correlates with my depression but hopefully I might have given a small idea of my thoughts.

(This is just going to be a rant/vent/cathartic exercise for me and I'd appreciate if you read it but I realise you have better things to do with your lives...) 

That's not strictly true, I know exactly why I'm crying, her name was Tash, she was my fiancé... We were high school sweethearts and had been dating for just 6 months when I knew this was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with so I took her a cliff overlooking a magnificent beach, it was glorious day, spirits were hight and as she was taking some photos I quietly wrapped my arms around her and held the ring in front of the camera lens, no words were needed we both burst into tears and she just kept saying yes over and over again

Fast forward 3 years later and we're both in the same university, living together and enjoying planning our future together and enjoying our pretend ""married life"" and we had to have a short time apart as I had got 2 jobs 2 hours away and was working 18 hr days so I could save up for a trip home to Zimbabwe for my 21st birthday, because I hadn't seen my mother in nearly 4 years so it was much needed. 

Anyway, we see each other sporadically over a period of about 10 weeks and we get back together in September when uni starts again and things are all hunky dory again, or so I though. Then come the end of the semester and the Christmas break I head home for a month and I get one 5 minute phone call for my birthday and nothing more, I think it's strange but put it down to her busy-ness over the Christmas break, come time for me to come home she doesn't pick me up from the airport or meet me off the train that I had to get as a result with the excuse that she couldn't get off work... 

Fast forward to this day a year ago and we sit down and have a long hard chat about the future and I asked a simple enough question : ""If I had to to go home to Zimbabwe, to look after my mom if she got sick or something, would you come with me?"" and she said ""No, I'd choose my career over our relationship every time"" 

We started arguing as to why not and it came out that she had cheated on me multiple times during the time I was working over the summer and the reason she couldn't pick me up from the airport was because she was in bed with a guy that day... This basically broke me emotionally and mentally, and sent me into a debilitating depression and multiple suicide attempts and hospitalisations

It's been a tough year with some days lower than others, on and off different anti-depressants but you guys on here have helped out tremendously and I thought I was out of my depressive state but I woke up and looked at the date, wondered why it stuck out in my mind, and then it hit me, like a punch in the gut, like the air had been sucked out of my lungs and I just sat on the edge of the bed and wept, letting a flood of painfully happy memories wash over me, consume me, and sap me of any motivation I had left... 

I thought I was over this but this still happens to me?  What the hell is wrong with me, I've had girl friends and slept with other girls in this past year, will I always feel like this? I'm very tempted by the thought of suicide, but I can't even work up the motivation to do anything about it...

I'd rather label the girl as a ""bitch"" or ""not good enough for me"" or some other label that is really just revisionist bullshit to make myself feel better. This fixes nothing and is petty. I do anyway, and scold myself shortly thereafter. Not good territory to be in. It seems hard to be emotionally honest with myself when I feel like a failure. 

Look up the research done on [love shyness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_shyness). It isn't well-known, and I""m not sure how legit it is. But you need to know you aren't alone. I haven't read the book, but I have read some of the research on it, and a lot of it does fit me. Also, I always remember Thom Yorke of Radiohead saying in an interview how uncomfortable beautiful women make him sometimes.

Lately, I've been investigating the possibility that I have a mood disorder of some sort. Check my post history, I posted something not too long ago about bipolar vs unipolar depression. These emotions should not destabilize you as much as they do, you know? This is no way to live. In your case, I think the emotions you are experiencing are telling you things that aren't necessarily true, but you think they are, because they seem so damn real. I lose sight of a lot of things when this hits me, and there's little I can do except buckle down, take it easy, and hope it will pass.

She didn't tell me about her depression until about a year into our relationship. We have essentially spent most of our free time together for the past 2 years, but she recently moved to graduate school across the state. Since she's moved, her depression has gotten worse, and I feel completely helpless at times.

Instead of making things better for her, I seem to make things worse. We regularly fight because she believes I'm not understanding, and I don't prioritize her. Most of our arguments start with me saying something that she says is insensitive. I try my best to understand that she has these terrible feelings and thoughts, but sometimes I say something to aggravate those feelings of depression.

I just want to help, and be there for her.

I know that the way she feels is real, and I don’t want to belittle her. I know that I was incredibly insensitive in the past. I didn’t understand depression as much as I do right now, and looking back at some of the things I did or said makes me upset at myself for being a terrible boyfriend. She still sees those things I’ve done in me now even though I’m trying to be a better person and I know she can’t forget them.

She’s all alone in a new city with no friends or family with so much on her plate. I want to be there for her because I love her so much.

I am an only child. Mom raised me up by herself. Nothing bad has really ever happened to me. I just started to loathe life around age 15 or so. Got really bad in early college. Still got a 2 year degree but to me it doesn't mean anything. I now work for a good company and have worked there for 2 years 3 months now. If I continue to live, I know I'd retire from this company (age 23 by the way). The work is easy. The pay is ok, not amazing but ok. The benefits are out of this world amazing (100% paid for health insurance). Despite all of this, I still want to commit suicide. Since my employment, for 2 years 3 months now I have started to eat healthier but still hate life. Although eating/drinking healthy has been great for about 1.5 years straight now. I tried giving exercise a chance but I hate it. 5'5"" and a half male, 162 pounds. Could probably lose about 10 pounds to be in the healthy BMI category. I always research on ways to end it and have for about 4 years now. Jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge seems like the most ideal spot, but I see that a barrier will be put up soon. I would prefer to jump from extremely high up to end it so there's no going back and little/no pain. Never held a gun in my life and I wouldn't know the type of gun/bullets needed. Plus I would fear the fact if I survived the shot and didn't have the strength or mental ability to re-grab the gun and finish the job. These are the only two methods I think of daily. No other method seems practical for me. I have never done drugs of any kind, including marijuana. And the last time I was drunk was December 2012. I gambled on my 18th birthday and haven't gambled since. I don't believe in any religion or god. I know it is disappointing when I say I don't care how my mom would handle me committing suicide and I am that selfish where I'd commit suicide anyways if it was 100% guarantee I would not feel pain. I feel like I am thinking clearly when I say I want suicide to occur. I work five 8 hour days. I am single, child-less, pet-less and rent in an apartment setting. Have been single and a virgin my entire life. Sadly I don't think I have the energy for a relationship nor do I really want a relationship. I definitely do not want any children. No need to hurt a young lady in my life. I am an introvert and hate the partying/bar, clubs, etc. scenes. I am also scared of the fact if I fail at a suicide attempt and then I lose my job because of it. My employment is at will and they can let you go for any reason at any time. And if I lost a job as good as this one and I had to keep living, I'd hate my life even more. I also never missed a day of work for Personal/Medical time (only planned vacation days). My job also has Employee Assistance Program, although I have never utilized the program. I have never seen a therapist. I do know you get 2 free visits per calendar year. My job also is not a desk-job and forced me to be on my feet the entire shift, which is fine by me. I could never sit in a cubicle. I'd commit suicide in about 1 weeks time if that was the only form of employment for me. I also do not have any energy to buy/maintain a house and yardwork. Sadly in my town, there are no condos/townhouses. I have some kind of home buyers certificate but I have no intention to buy a house. I just don't care and don't want to devote time to that and know I would be too lazy to do anything productive. I do love sleeping. I don't take pills. But I wish there was a way to sleep forever. I know I don't have things nearly as bad as other people do. I wouldn't even classify it as bad. I just hate life in general. I know, I'm a terrible person. Never done reddit before.

28504,,True,blastfemur,,,,"If I were you, I would talk to a trained professional therapist, to express your feelings so you can examine and organize them to a point where they are manageable, too. This helped me get through a very stressful time at work when major aspects of my environment were not under my control.   

In addition to therapy, all I can really tell you is what eventually worked for me.

I spent many years suffering from depression, to the point of not being able to get out of bed for approximately a year. I too had taken a prescription med for it, but I was upset by some of the scary side effects the medicine seemed to cause, so I slowly stopped taking it. I was at my wit's end, and I just wanted to sleep all the time and/or die, whichever came first. Then I happened to hear a tiny bit of information on TV that changed my life.

The guy on TV said that what appears to be depression can sometimes be caused by nutritional deficiencies, most specifically a lack of protein in the diet. He suggested starting each day with a serving of lean protein, and then to eat healthily (including more protein) for the rest of the day, including taking sufficient vitamin supplements.

When I thought about it, it made sense, because while everyone seems to agree that depression is caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, almost no one points out that the way we deliver chemicals to our brains is most directly by what we ingest.

So I gave it a try. I started eating about 3 oz of lean turkey the first thing every morning (actually it's the second thing, after I take my fiber supplement, which I require to remain regular, which can also affect depression). Anyway, I supplemented my protein serving with a 1/3 cup serving of oatmeal prepared with 1/4 cup of walnuts (for the omega-3 fatty acids), topped with real maple syrup, and followed with a glass of orange juice fortified with calcium and vitamin D (also said to fight depression, and for me, anxiety especially.) I also started taking a good multi-vitamin daily, in addition to other daily supplements that sounded good to me (magnesium, vitamin E, Super vitamin B complex, a fish oil combination, biotin, etc.)

In addition to these changes in nutrition, I completely quit ingesting all caffeine and alcohol products. (I had quit smoking cigarettes and marijuana years before.) I've often suspected that these toxins can only adversely affect my depressive symptoms.

While this may have only worked for me, I was happily surprised that my depression and anxiety diminished far below my level of awareness. (Sometimes I even feel like I'm not sad enough when situations would warrant it!) 

The reason I know that this is a cause and effect is because a few times since I started, during some hectic times in which I was unable to fully control my breakfast ingredients for a few days (when on vacation or hosting numerous guests) my depression starts to creep back, and my anxiety returns full blast within a few days; as soon as I return to the ""protein, first thing"" breakfast with the oatmeal/walnuts/maple syrup and the vitaminD/calcium/OJ, my depression and anxiety are gone within a day or two.

I cannot claim that this would work for anyone else, but I thought I should at least relate my story. My assumption is that a good nutritional foundation is required to allow even prescribed medications to work to their fullest ability. In my experience, a healthy nutritional foundation is the first step towards regaining a stable mental outlook.",,0.0,,2012-11-18 05:16:06,,,0,1353217752,,,,0,,c732pdu,,,,,t3_13dnaw,,,t1_c732pdu,,,,t3_13dnaw,,,,,,,,1430435659.0,,4,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,4,,

I should start out by stating that I am a 20 yr old female and was diagnosed with depression when I was 16. I have been cutting myself since I was 13, summer of 2006.

This past semester, I have been seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner, and it's been helpful. She prescribed me Zoloft, then switched to Prozac. Since the switch, about 4.5 weeks ago, I haven't taken anything. I have been able to feel again, been able to cry, been able to genuinely laugh, not be angry all the time. However, I can be extremely happy now, but also extremely sad, extremely angry, etc.

My need/want to cut fluctuates.. I feel numb for a few weeks and I know if I cut I'll be able to feel (physically and emotionally) again. Then I severely limit what I eat. Then I'm fine. Then it starts again.

I'm feeling myself feel the need to cut again and I'm praying to God all the time to give me the strength not to (I'm a devout Catholic, if that's of any need). 

I'm just asking for prayers/positive thoughts/good vibes/encouraging words (that aren't cliche)/whatever works for you.

This is my first time on this sub, let alone posting, and I was mostly just posting to find some advice. 
I've dealt with depression before, about six years back when my grandfather died. I am familiar with the hopelessness, worthlessness, general feeling of apathy and long bouts of sadness. I've read a lot about depression because of my past experience with it, but after that spell I haven't ever experienced it to such a degree, and I've never been in a relationship with anyone who has suffered from a mental illness, so I felt that this sub might help with my problem.
My boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly a year now and he is suffering from depression, and it's something that troubles me daily because I don't know how to act around him. A few months before we started dating a close family member of his died, and he considered this person one of his best friends. My boyfriend came to my group of friends because he knew my roommate from work, and while he was dealing with his loss he came over frequently to hang out with all of us and confide in us. He was mostly close with my other friends at first, but we eventually started talking and a relationship kindled. He got upset sometimes, but not with me. Little things tend to bother him and he'll get frustrated or annoyed, but we never had many major problems, and he never really talked about depression. 
Fast forward to now, and we still get along very well but there are some things that tend to go wrong and they make me concerned. The friends we both shared turned out, about three months into my relationship with my boyfriend, to be really horrible people, and they attacked both my boyfriend and I for being ""shitty friends"" when the opposite was true. I had to move in with my mother, and while my boyfriend stopped talking to my old friends, he had had a lot of animosity towards them towards the end and knew they were shitty, so I didn't think it made a really great impact on him (compared to me since I had been friends with them throughout childhood). Lately, it's really just been me and my boyfriend, and we spend at least four hours together every day. He sees other friends of his sometimes, too, and I've talked to him about how I feel like I'm stealing him from his old life, or worried that he's unhappy with less friends, but he claims that he is happy with both me and his friends.
To the problem in itself. Things will go really really well for about a week or so before something sort of shitty happens between me and my boyfriend. We are very loving to each other, but sometimes he gets frustrated or distant out of nowhere and it confuses me a lot. Yesterday, for example, we had been texting very romantically all day, and we planned to get together in the evening for a birthday dinner for his mother. He came to get me and I could tell he was annoyed about something, but a lot of the time when I sense this I will ask and he will not tell me what's wrong. Instead of asking I just talked about my day, especially about my sister visiting because I have a strained relationship with her. Sometimes he is very engaged and attentive, but it was apparent he didn't want to talk or just didn't care and so I just decided to let it go and wait to see if he had something to talk about. We got to his house and his mom was making dinner and he was being very short with her and eventually she left to go run errands before dinner. We sat at his table and he ignored me while he was browsing on his phone, and I just sat there and stared into space until I suggested we do something because I was getting bored. Mind you, we've talked many many times about me getting upset with him over things I can control, so despite the fact that I was annoyed I tried to sound as calm as possible to communicate effectively. After I suggest this, though, he drops his phone and gets obviously upset. I tend to over react, so I went into the bathroom to try to prevent myself from crying, because frustration and anger reminds me of my dad, but that's something I'm working through with therapy. Despite feeling upset I suggested we go walking, and we got halfway to our destination before (while I was just talking about some random subject) he stops walking and angrily tells me he wants to go back because it's hot. I got upset, and I understand I really shouldn't have, and as we were walking home I told him that even if he wasn't mad with me (he claimed he was mad about the way his parents planned dinner) I didn't like being yelled at for just wanting to hang out or pass time. Apparently that was the bad thing to do, and he went off about things I didn't even really know he was upset about. He said he couldn't talk to me without me getting unreasonably upset (this is true but I feel he is not appreciating how better I've gotten about this) and he said he was depressed and couldn't talk to me about anything without me talking about my old friends or my sister instead. I felt horrible and he might actually be right, but I always felt that I asked what was wrong every time he seemed upset or down and always got shot down because he didn't want to talk. He said this was because I brought things up at bad times, and I just couldn't remember well enough to know who was right. I just felt so bad and sick about it.
That was maybe the third or fourth time he has mentioned depression, and he has only mentioned it when things are really tense between us. When we started dating we had a regular sex life, not every day but frequently enough, and he was always very affectionate and attracted to me. Now I get very confused because I feel he is attracted or wants to have sex, but when I persist he gets awkward and asks if we can do it another time instead. I used to get upset but he has told me it is because he doesn't feel happy with himself and is depressed, which I understand, but I'm so confused when it comes to responding to that. I've worked on it and now I say, it's okay, and kiss him and try to not make a big deal out of it, but he gets upset regardless of how I respond, and I just don't know how to respond to it anymore.
I just feel I'm walking on eggshells a lot. Sometimes he'll get upset because I want to do things, and he doesn't want to. He has gotten upset at me because we both felt really sick on a four hour car trip and it was hard for both of us to drive, but I felt he discounted my sickness and was upset at me for not being able to control it. He told me he was tired of our relationship even though I was only visibly upset because my leg was in terrible pain, not because I was mad at him. That hurt so much, and that was one of the few times he has gone off and said hurtful things but obviously seemed to regret it. 
He has talked to me about why he is depressed, but I feel he talks more about it to his friends or sister around me rather than directly to me in privacy. He never mentions his family member's death, though he was still very hurt by it when his sister talked to him in front of me. If I ask him about anything that is emotional or painful, no matter the time, he'll just say he doesn't want to talk. I get that, but he obviously does talk about it, and I'm worried he just doesn't trust me? And now he's blaming me for not caring and I don't know what to do. He never asks me about something upsetting me, if it upsets me the only way I go about it is straight up telling him, but I feel the same doesn't apply to him. He doesn't come out talking about something that upsets him the majority of the time, I either have to ask or if it involves me it blows up in my face when he can't take dealing with it. 
I know this is long and rant-y but, like I've said, I've never been with someone so depressed. I don't know how to talk to him, I don't know when to leave him alone, when to persist, I don't know what to say that's right, I don't even know how to apologize while also letting him know that his behavior hurts me. I just don't know and I feel really selfish, guilty, and horrible a lot of the time when he's down or out because there's always something I do to get under his skin. I know I am not perfect and not always the best support, but I also feel like he doesn't always see what I do for him, and he gets to visibly wrapped up and upset about these things. I'm trying to change as much as I can to not make him upset, but sometimes I feel like I'm compromising too much, and I feel there has to be a better way to talk to him or see what he's going through without these angry explosions. He refuses to see a doctor or go to therapy as well, and as someone in therapy I think it would help him with at least letting off some steam from the annoyances in his day to day life that make him stressed. Does anyone deal with something similar? Are there things, as a depressed person, that helps you interact with loved ones or communicate with them better despite the depression? Are there things that are hard to hear? Better ways to be talked to? Any advice will suffice, honestly. I just feel like I never help, and I know that's not my job, but sometimes I just feel like I make it way, way worse. Any ideas or advice?

TL;DR:
My boyfriend suffers from depression but thinks I don't care about how he feels. I don't think he's entirely wrong (in terms of me not understanding what to say or how to act), but I just don't know how to act around him or even what to say to him that won't make things worse when he is upset about something.

It was obvious she hadn't been doing this for very long.   I wanted to tell her to leave but I felt like that would be insulting her.  So I tried my best to bang her but even my 23 year old penis couldn't stay hard for that long.  She knew instantly that I was the kind of man that could only have sex with someone I cared for, she was right.  She told me as much.  I didn't know what to say so I didn't say anything.  She asked me if I wanted to hang out some time but I didn't want to, because I was thinking I didn't want to be seen with a prostitue, and I wasn't attracted to her anyway.  So again I pretty much said nothing.

Many years later I look on this experience as...I don't know.  I couldn't really care less about the $200.  I didn't get a girlfriend out of it.  I didn't get an orgasm out of it, and even if I had cum it would have been more reflex than pleasure.  It didn't make me feel less lonely.  It didn't really do anything.  I never got one again.

I missed so much school in high school, and finally did my senior year from home just to get it over with. 
I had an ""off again on again"" friend that I med in 10th grade. She would hang out with me when she had nothing better to do. I would just stop hanging out with her for a year or two at a time because I didn't like being around her, I always felt she was taking advantage of me because I always tried to just do anything to please her so I would have a friend. I never left the house and for almost 2 years we had no internet access of any kind at home. So all I did was lock myself in my room, sleep as much as I could, and write or draw in journals, oh and listen to music. I would lie on the floor listening to music all the time.

I was fortunate that I had made some friends online and I would write letters back and forth with them so I wasn't completely shut off from everyone. And a couple times a month I'd spend the night at my grandmothers and stay up on the internet the whole time.

My mom was not supportive in the least and would scream at me constantly. It was really rough and things stayed rough until I finally moved out when I was 24.  Things are still rough obviously because you don't just stop having clinical depression, or bipolar, or just problems from life in general. But I'm getting better at dealing with things.   

I think getting into a regular school is a good idea. You can meet some people there. If not high school you can meet people in college. People act like high school is the best years of your life and they really aren't if you ask most people. You have plenty to look forward to.

No one, including me, understands why I can't just fucking do it.  I've obviously been depressed for years, that's part of it.  I'm almost 29 years old and I'm living with my mom, not working and abusing drugs.  I'm only happy when I get my adderall refilled, which I privately and shamefully refer to us as ""coming alive""

When I'm not ""alive"" I don't feel or do much of anything.  I sleep.  I hide.  I avoid.  The drugs were an accidental and clearly misguided attempt to fix the depression, rather than depression resulting from drug abuse.  It's not like I suddenly thought, ""Hey!  A drug addiction is the thing for me!""  I just tried some once, and I felt better, so I got some more and so on and so on.  I've abused opiates in the past, but speed actually makes me feel like I don't have depression for the first time in my life.

Until I run out.  Then I hibernate, days go by in a hazy blur of nothingness, just nothing.  I know the drugs are bad, but I don't think they're my primary concern right now.  I didn't do shit when I was sober either.

I've been taking baby steps towards re-entering the world.  Stupid embarrassingly difficult things like actually brush my teeth that day.  I've got back in contact with my friends, and I have great friends, but I just couldn't talk to anyone these past couple years.  I've still turned down excuses to hang out.  Made future promises.

My next step, the big one, is getting a job.  I need routine, this lazy absence of anything at all is killing me, like my entire body is screaming all the time.  When I get to the Job Experience portion of an application, I freeze up.  Five fucking years of unemployment, I look like I'm crazy, I am kind of crazy.  It forces me to think about it, immediately creates the question ""What have you done these past 5 years?"" and is so goddamn shameful I can't bear to have it floating around in my head.

I've done one application.  It was torture, having to type out all these sadly pathetic details.  Time I worked there?  Uh, 3 months.  Why did I leave?  I was fired for consistently being late.

I just feel like such a hopeless fuck up.  I just now tried to write a clever metaphor to explain my outlook on life, deleted it three times and finally settled on I have no outlook on life. I don't see myself committing suicide in the future, I don't see myself in the future at all.

I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this.  Maybe it'll help and I'll feel relieved when I hit post and it's finally off my chest, or someone will reply and say the right thing, or if nothing else I'll have no more excuses to procrastinate.

What your saying is pretty profound. The enebitibility of death is something we all think about and all wonder. It is something that we have no power or control over. 

I have struggled with hopelessness for a long part of my life. I would always feel as though nothing i did mattered. That there was no point in changing anything in my life, because in the end it will all be the same. I still struggle with that on a daily basis. Here I am 32 still living with my parents, single, no career, and just dropped out of school. It dosnt seem like things will ever be the way I want them to be. And I dont want much honestly. I just want to feel like I can stand on my own, not have to rely on others, and become independent. Every step I take, it feels like I have to take 2 more back. And every year that passes, I feel like i have wasted time.

But here is where I find hope. I find it in the world around me. I am thankful that I am able to catch a gimpse of the world around me as it changes. I am greatful that I exist in a golden age of wonder and progress. And I am happy to share my experience with others who see the same things a little differently.

I was with my high school girlfriend for about 5 years, from Junior year of high school until the end of my Junior year in college (took a gap year between high school and college). In high school we depended on each other heavily, and formed what for us was a necessary relationship just to get though it all. We both lost most of our friends being ""that couple"" who always hung out, and after high school we had plenty of other issues. Today she's living in a town about 2 hours away, living in a house with her new boyfriend who is 30 years old. I'm 23 and so is she. It's not really important now, but what is important to me is getting over her.

Since then I've had two girlfriends, both really great, very cute. I tried so hard to form the kind of bond I had with my first girlfriend, but it just wasn't the same. I think a lot of it is just how much we needed and depended on each other for so many years. This last week my second girlfriend and I broke up, and within a few days I was still more depressed and thinking about my high school girlfriend than the one I had just ended things with. Throughout both relationships she was always in the back of my mind, and no day goes by where I don't think about her. We've talked sporadically in the past year, and I know I need to just stop talking to her completely.

It's like my mind plays tricks with me. I am going to the first concert I have ever been to, and can't smile because of my reflection reminding me how I really am.

I hate myself, I hate my body, and I wish I were never even alive. Nothing brings me joy anymore, and even in her last moments, mom tore me down. Now I hear her inside my head, like she's still there mocking me, goading me on trying to get me to give up.

Despite this being a throwaway account, this is actually my first     post. The other day I cam upon the realization that I'm not sure     who I am any more. I'm certainly not the person I was at the     beginning of the year. I've been sort of slipping for a while now.     I've felt down, and slightly uninterested in things. At first I was     able to tell myself that it was just part of growing up. I'm 17,  Maybe I was just growing out of the things I used to care about.    
But honestly it has progressed to the point where, as I stated    
earlier, I'm not sure who I am any more.

 I used to have hobbies    
that I loved doing, and a solid plan for my future that I looked    
forward to fulfilling. But recently I've lost interest completely    
in all my hobbies, and I've given up on the chance of fulfilling    
*any* future, much less the one I had originally set out to    
achieve. I haven't told anyone how I feel, because generally    
sharing my feelings just makes me feel worse. But I feel like at this point I need to reach out and get help before I slip over the     edge and lose all interest in helping myself too. But I'm anxious    about it, unsure of how exactly to proceed.

I'd tell my friends, but they probably don't care enough, I'd tell    my parents, but I don't want them to walk on eggshells around 
me, because that would make it worse. I was thinking about talking    to my counselor, but I'm nervous that he will go straight 
to my parents. I don't know what to do, but I do know that I need    
to do something. Day by day I find it harder and harder to care    
about anything or anyone. I've let go of any hopes for my future,    
and I find myself sleeping not because I'm tired, but because it    
is more preferable than being awake.

 There are times when I'm    
not sure if what I'm feeling is actually depression, but due to my    
unwillingness to share my thoughts with the people around me, I didn't    know where else to turn. My hopes are that through the    
anonymity of this account I can clearly describe my problems, and    
hopefully receive some advice as to how to proceed. Once again, I'm    sorry if this breaks any rules or is in the correct place, but I've    kept this in me for too long, and I guess I just needed to let    
out a cry for help...

36884,,True,EmPtY7even,,,,"I don't think I can suggest too much more than what has already been said. Exercise is great, a run has always helped level me out. Also, if you don't eat, force yourself. Not eating only makes you more tired, it make your muscles ache which means they're eating at themselves because you're not giving them nutrients, and it can make you feel sick. All of these things together definitely don't help your mood.

You don't have to keep your high school relationships. Quite frankly I'm happy I let a lot of mine die off after a while. Looking back now they weren't the best for me. Even my Ex was really bad for me when i thought she was awesome at the time. HOWEVER! Don't stop being social! The human mind is as wonderful as it is terrible. It can be a bad place if you're let alone with it. I would force myself to go hang out with my friends and girlfriend even when I didn't want to. Looking back at it these relationships helped me stay positive. My friends made me laugh, helped me out sometimes and mainly helped to distract me from my pain.

Find an outlet of sorts. Maybe a hobby, or something you can partake in whether it be reading, volunteer work, exercise, or building models. Keep in mind that sitting around is not going to get you anywhere. That old saying ""time heals all wounds"" is utter bullshit. It's what you do with that time that heals wounds. Unless you're actively moving forward in your life it's not going to go anywhere. Just don't think you need to be rolling in cash or at your physical peak to be accomplishing something. A few weeks ago there was a person on here who had grown two very small bean sprouts in a plastic cup and that was enough to make him legitimately happy for the first time in a while. Something as simple as eating a healthy meal can be a milestone. Don't judge yourself too harshly for what you haven't done. Be happy for what you have done.

Also, I feel the same way as you sometimes. In that, I realize I'm not responsible for the things that happen in my life but I still get down on myself. It's a sucky feeling but my above paragraph is how I deal with it. An activity might not be what helps you out but there has to be something you can use to combat your feelings. You just need to figure that out.

You're going through a rough time and it's going to take a lot of hard work and time on your part to get out of it. Trust me. You will. It might not be anytime soon but when you do you'll be thankful you've pulled through. Everything is so much clearer and beautiful on the other side.

I was on opioids for 3 years, and drank VERY heavily for the past 6 years. About a fifth of whiskey a day. I'm 25 years old. I've been in school this entire time, off &amp; on due to being in and out of detox/rehab.

Up until getting a job for a small moving company a few months ago, I hadn't worked in 4 years. 

Depression has obviously been an issue I've been dealing with, alongside the alcoholism/addiction. Co-morbid.

I am now starting to become very panicky/anxious about career/job/future stuff.

I don't know where to begin. With anything. I have no relevant experience in anything outside of a coffee shop or grocery store, and on paper it looks like I haven't worked since I was 20 years old - because essentially I haven't. And I don't even have a degree yet. I probably need about a year of school until I can graduate, and that'd just be in Arts/Literature or Psych/Religious Studies depending, I suppose, on what classes I take.

Local grocery stores won't even hire me/call back at this point. I am looking for volunteer work but can't find any. Internships - none I even qualify for through my community college. I am growing increasingly depressed and hopeless about my future. It appears that I have none.

I have absolutely ZERO desire to work an apprenticeship for 5 years, i.e., become an electrician - but that seems like a viable option. Military would be an option if it weren't for the problems I'd have staying sober in it. On top of my mental health issues.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and found direction in life? There are no careers which seem appealing to me. I used to enjoy writing &amp; making music, but sober - not so much. I don't even have that anymore. 

It seems that I am anhedonia incarnate. 

How has anyone managed to manage having a life with depression/anxiety/addiction issues? I want to move out of my parents house, have a decent paying job, etc...I just don't know how or where to start, because everything I try seems to fail. This is the first time in my life I've even started thinking about this stuff, and now strongly regret my decisions to pursue creative things, half-assedly over the years. I'm a burnout, I think. 

Can't get hired if I have no experience. Can't get experience if I won't get hired. A job will look interesting to me, then I see what it takes to get to the point where you'd even be considered (i.e., 2 years, 4 years, 8 years school, experience in the field, etc...) and automatically feel dejected.

Typing this at 3am on a day off (we'll get to that). I'm not fully depressed, but I'm very susceptible at the moment.

2 years and a month ago I was about to get depressed. I was studying at university, but had only 1 course left. Most of my friends got jobs or internships that year, I didn't. I had a weekend night job, but it had nothing to do with my field. I was seeing someone for a short time, but she didn't think it would work so she broke up with me.

A week later I caught an amazing break (though I did not know it at the time). Colleague of mine asked me out. I always enjoyed her company immensely when I saw her at work. So we went out and had a blast. We started seeing more and more often. I took more shifts at work making it a full-time job. I basically kissed the University and my old life a goodbye though I did continue to search for an internship/job.

I was ridiculously happy. Not only did we love each others company, we also had almost all the same days off and the same sleeping pattern (we were doing only night shifts) so we were able to do all kinds of fun. We travelled everywhere and partied alot. I liked her family and friends alot, but she didn't like mine. I didn't much care. So we spent most of our time with her social circles (I was losing even more of my own life, though I didn't notice or give a flying fuck at the time). I moved in with her after just 3 months. Very soon we were already planning our future together. Life was so good.

Fast forward to 13 months together. Her birthday was coming. I had made her a cake and bought two presents she had wanted for a long time. I was working the night, she was home alone drinking. Alcohol had become a bit of a problem. She'd call me all night and was very happy until 4am when she was supposed to go to bed. We said good nights. But she called shortly after and she felt like a different person. I don't know what it was she got mad about, but it was clear she just wanted to argue. When my shift ended and I got home, the door was locked from the inside. I had to retreat to my parent's house on her birthday morning...

We made up after I woke up and we had a nice rest of the day, but it was clear that enough alcohol changed her personality. This was evident again roughly a month later when we came home from night out. We watched some tv, she continued to drink and boom, a fight out of nowhere. I wanted no part of it (man I wish I would have just told her I love her instead of walking angrily away) so I told her I'd go to bed. When I went to brush my teeth she stormed after me, shut the lights from the bathroom and blocked the door from outside. I didn't try to negoatiate. I just tried to push the door open without luck. I waited a few minutes and then bust the door.

Now we did have an amazing relationship still, but I guess these events started to haunt both of us. Last summer our sex life slowly died. We still loved each others company and it's not quite sure what happened to her not wanting to have sex anymore. Anyway, she didn't want to talk about the problem which made me really upset.

Constant rejection ate my self esteem and I became jealous. So I began to suspect cheating and in August I read her facebook. There were 1500 messages between her and a male colleague. Some flirting, but not clear enough to know for sure. When I was about to confront her she came up with a solution to the dead bedroom, that it was her birth control pills. Ok, great that she'd try to work on our relationship, but I had to ask about the colleague. And because I'm a bad liar I told her I read her facebook. Long story short: we continued for a month until she broke up with me.

So there I was, alone. My life and happiness had been built around her. We were to get married, have kids and a house. Now I have just my own life. The life I abandoned more than two years ago. It's like I had to get it from garage and blow the dust off. There will be no marriage, kids or house for a long time. I'm working a dead end job that kills all social life because it's night shifts and weekends. My studies still lack the master's thesis. Add to that I'm already 30 and it's a nice recipe for full depression.

Of course I began to work on myself after the breakup. I applied to all jobs that matched my studies. I searched for an apartment and tried to up my social life. And I did make some progress. I will be moving to a new great apartment in a week. I've been seeing someone who finally gets my mind off the ex. Only the most important thing, a new job, seems like an impossible feat. And everything seems to rely on getting that job.

We have no mutual days off with this new girl. She works 9-5 monday-friday. I work basically 6pm-6am thursday to sunday. We see 2 or 3 times a week and can't spend the nights together, because I can't change my sleeping pattern on my days off. I'm starting to fall for this girl and now I'm really afraid she won't tolerate the lack of time together for much longer. Also I want to take her somewhere, but how can I when I'm always working on weekends?!

So it's 4am now and I can't sleep nor will I want to because it's going to be day soon. I'm typing this because there is absolutely nothing constructive I can do at this time of day. I tried to look for jobs online, but there are none. I could go to Uni today and start working on my master's degree, but it's going to take 8 months minimum. And when it's finished there's still no guarantee I'll be any more successful at the job hunt. And I'm once again way too dependent on a girl for my happiness and I'm afraid that it will scare her away even if our lack of time together doesn't.

I could probably change my job to some no-skills-required day job, but I actually enjoy my current one and it pays decent, so I don't think I want to change it to something I don't like that pays less.

""You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...""

""Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You""

235050,,True,Thug-boat,,,,"No. I used to smoke whenever I could (which was very often), and trust me when I say that I'm a lot better off now that I've quit. You are going through withdrawals (yes, pot withdrawals are a thing). Chances are you aren't sleeping as well, you're more agitated, you're bored, and more. When you're body gets used to weed, whenever you don't have the ""normal"" amount in your body, it does the opposite of what weed does for you. 

Part of the reason I smoked so much was because I hated my parents house. Everything about it. I didn't like them, it was always dirty, we didn't have nice things, I lived in the unfinished basement, etc. I used it as an escape. If you can, figure out what you don't like about your life and work towards fixing it. I completely wasted most of my high school years being stoned in my basement. 

I don't know what you are fighting with your parents about, but try and talk to them about it. Not trying to sound like a therapist or whatever, but the words ""I feel ________"" are very powerful. Whatever you don't like about yourself, do your best to make changes.

Smoking pot isn't bad every once in a while, but for people who make a habit out of it, it really is bad. It gets to a point where you are only at 100% when you are high, and when you aren't it's more like 80% or less. If I were you, I'd quit cold turkey. Maybe when you're life is in a bit better of a situation you could have a bowl on a Saturday night or something, but trust me when I say it will only keep you down.

Murder, serious injury, rape, slow lingering disability, suicide and death there isn't much out there I haven't seen/experienced in some way. 

I wouldn't say I'm bitter at the world but I would say that I am generally unfeeling on the inside. I think over time I have learnt that emotional attachment is to be hurt, that the ultimate way for emotional stability is to not care for those around you. An extreme emotional detachment. 

I might hang out with people for my own benefit, I consider the social scene mutually beneficial. Yet it is like I have an inability to care whether these people live or die, leave my life or stay. My best friend may get deported soon I can't say it bothers me, to be honest I'm worried I will get stuck with his cats and have to find a home for them because I already have a cat. I had a friend that was murdered, I can't say I shed a tear. Not that long ago I watched my grandmother who I was somewhat close to die slowly in hospital begging for a quick death we couldn't give her, I think I was a little sad but it didn't really get to me. I'd seen a lot of bad things before these events they weren't that draining because I've learnt not to care.

I used to think not caring being as I am was a good thing. The ideal way to live life but I've come to realize a person cannot be dead on the inside without wishing their outside was dead too. Yet I don't know how to get better from here.

30780,,True,AlmightyScoosh,,,,"A few weeks ago I had a job interview for a secure psychiatric facility for 12-18 year old teens and this topic came up. The information I obtained from that meeting was:

Relationships between patients are heavily discouraged. The main focus of the patient is to be their recovery and therapeutic process. Whilst the staff will not forbid them, it isn't encouraged.
Obviously for your situation it's different, as you've already been in a relationship. But I would expect the priorities of the staff to remain consistent, the patients emotional well-being is their first priority. Relationships for patients were described to me as an unnecessary distraction, which can cause the patient to relapse and further emotional turmoil. I know this isn't the greatest news in the world, but I'm just telling you honestly. As I said, no one will forbid a relationship from happening, but the first priority is the patient's well-being. 

Patients have regular visitors from friends and family, after all they are not prisoners. They can receive and make calls, and receive/send gifts too, although obviously gifts have to be assessed for potential ligature potential, eg. No sharp edges. Soft toys, photographs, sweets and DVDs are all good. 
From what I saw, these units are really beneficial to the people inside them, and the staff at the one I visited were professional, well trained and effective. They hired a range of people including teachers to come and tutor patients during the day, and a wide range of sporting/craft activities. The particular one I visited has a football pitch and Jacuzzi. It was pretty awesome, but I'm sure there is a ton of variation.

260222,,True,svabhava-sunya,,,,"It's sad to hear that your previous visit to discuss depression with your GP didn't go well - regardless of whether medication would be appropriate for you, they shouldn't have made you feel guilty or offered you no help/advice at all. The fact that you've decided to seek help for your mental health in itself is a big indicator that something is not right and it ought to be taken seriously by a doctor, in my opinion. I don't profess any expertise in this area, so I cannot tell you what a doctor *should* do, but I can relate my own experiences and thoughts. Whether this is indicative or not I don't know, perhaps other redditors can chip in. 

Given the time constrains of most GP's these days, in my experience a GP will only have a brief chat with you about your symptoms before deciding whether anti-depressants are appropriate. This chat will focus on things like: your overall mood lately, how well you're sleeping (and if you feel fatigued during the day), how work is going, if you're eating enough, whether you're able to concentrate on things, how your relationships with friends and family are, and of course any thoughts of hurting yourself/suicide. They're trying to find out the extent to which your quality of life is affected by depression as it is clinically defined. I believe that they ought to be sympathetic, understanding and try to offer whatever help they can (in my experiences this is how they are the vast majority of the time). 

I can't say whether medication can or can't be of help to you but I would encourage you to go back and talk with your GP if you feel that they might be able to help - don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another doctor either if you're unhappy about the initial consultation.

I'm a twenty two year old boy living in California. I live in a cool small town and originally from Los Angeles. For the past two years, I have been floundering and stuck in this place. I haven't been growing and I've been working a bit, but I feel empathetic toward many things. Love, money, relationships, etc. I have a lot of projects I would like to start and can never seem to finish any of them or even start them, I am really passionate at first, then can never get them going and use excuses all the time, for anything. 

I've had anxiety in the past and slight depression but feel pretty out of that right now. I have good friends, a good life and a lot more, but I feel like I'm still floundering. 

My mom will get upset sometimes that I'm not applying to universities since I only have two years left and that I need to be doing something else but my main goal and dream would be to start a company in fashion or the clothing industry, such as retail or ecommerce and have worked in it before. I'm thinking of moving back to Los Angeles for the summer this year and start working there and change places to get something else going.

If anyone has any advice on how to work through this, I would love any feedback.

Thank you!

I rarely trust anyone. I try to, but people just have a knack for disappointing and letting others down. I know what that feels like. I can't trust my own parents and brother, I understand what you're going through. 

What you have to do is make it clear to yourself why you don't trust others. Is it just paranoia? Did they actually do something to let you down? Did they lie to you? Did they cause you physical/emotional harm? 

Make sure you just don't blindly have mistrust in people. Not trusting them is natural, not trusting them for no reason at all isn't.

Please don't feel shy about talking to your therapist about this. Tell them to keep it a secret from your family. As far as I known therapists cannot do so if you explicitly ask them to (not sure though).

I dont want others to feel the same pain because i know how much it hurts. The pain in my heart hurts more than the cold touch of a blade or the soothing warmth of a bottle. Tonight i feel very alone and my sorrow seeks to consume me. I wish that i had not drawn the depression card, it poisons my mind and leaves me broken.

I'm a 19 year old male, i have dealt with shyness/social anxiety since middle school. I finished my freshman year of college 2 weeks ago and since then I have only left my house two times and that was with this one friend I have from high school. I made no close friends in college. I had a small group of friends but they turned out to be lying, fake jerks. The rest of the time I stayed at home doing nothing on my computer all day being depressed. 

My parents have noticed my anti-social and abnormal behavior. Sometimes I will get very upset for no reason (not bi-polar, just frustrated). They know I am depressed and don't like my life I am living.I want to get a job, but I am even afraid to go out any apply because I am afraid people judge me for some reason. I have to pay off a 1350$ ticket for a weed charge too. I don't even smoke weed anymore it gives me crazy anxiety and paranoia. 

I don't receive the feedback from others I'd like to receive. I don't think I'm that ugly, but I have a really hard time communicating with people. It takes a shitload of courage for me to look someone in the eye. I feel like people think I'm weird. Personally I am a smart and nice person and wish I was able to communicate better but this lack of real life skills really gets in the way.

Well, I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow that my parents signed me up for... I am nervous and am scared to even speak to one. It's a girl doctor too so that will make it even more difficult. I have never had a single female friend in my entire years from middle school---&gt;now. Sad isn't it. 

I really don't know what happened to me.  I felt normal and sociable before. But college was a nightmare and I barely met anyone that was a genuine friend to me. 

I don't know what to do. I know my parents want me to be honest with the psychiatrist, but I really don't want to go but I know I have to. I am thinking about drinking a little vodka before going to help me not be so nervous, would that be okay? Just like one or two shots.

some things that used to help my social anxiety in the past were heroin and benzos. I haven't touched benzos for about a month, and I haven't touched opiates for a week and plan to quit all opiates. How can I get my psychiatrist to prescribe me benzos like xanax? Those really help me get out of my shell. And if anyone can share there psychiatrist/doctor talking experiences would be great.

Thanks for reading and please reassure me that things will be okay.",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,"I'm 19 years old with a social anxiety problem, forced to go see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

I seeked specialist care after my wee post. Realised things weren't getting better anytime fast. I started having multiple attacks to a many of triggers; grasses, dust mites, heat and aniexty. Starting visting A&amp;E many of times and being placed on the dredded pregnisone! &lt;-- horrible drug. So, I made an appointment to see one of the top Immunurologist in New Zealand (at a mere $380nzd). I've been placed on a cocktail of drugs; telfast 180mg, rantidine, colchicine - twice daily. I've noticed amazing results already, with a majority of my symptoms subsiding. However, I'm still getting daily attacks due to various triggers, but things do seem alot better. So here's hoping! Furthermore, he found that I have a fungus that could be causing my excema symptoms. But we can't tread it due to the drugs I'm currently on. I don't quite know how it works in the states, but if you can get ahold of any of these drugs, I'm sure you will notice vast improvement! I've also been under the care of a clinical psychologist, which will hopefully get me back on track - haha. As for the girl, I'm sure we will work things out.... It's quite amazing to find other people who are experiencing the same sort of condition and seeing how they are adapting to living with it. It's sort of rare to find other sufferers here in New Zealand. Of course there are people here with ecema, but chronic urticaria is rather uncommon. 

I see you wrote a line about joint pain! That interests me. Could you explain further on your joint pains? Would love to know if they are similar to those that I experience.

Anyway, thankyou for your reply! If you do indeed reply, I'll reply much faster. haha.

Parents are typically the ones whom offer validation for that part of yourself. With women you have to approach it in a clever way and at the right moment. Women don't want to raise YOU and another child, so you cannot indefinitely rely on them to offer you emotional support, this is something that is mostly offered within the family, you can in fact find it in a girlfriend -- just not indefinitely.

I don't know where to begin..
But I guess I have to start somewhere. I'm writing this as a coping mechanisim..hoping it will distract me from the pain, the anger, the anguish. I can express myself better in words...but I need to find the words to describe what I'm feeling..an impossible task really..I don't..I don't even know..I guess I will just have to pool everything out.

I don't know how long I've felt this for..all I know is that as every day passes, everything gets worse and worse. It's like someone is placing more and more weight on me everyday, and sometime or another soon I'm going to collapse. At my best estimate, I could say I've regarded myself as being 'depressed' since Christmas 2014..but I know, deep in my heart, even if I didn't recognize it then..that I've been dealing for this longer than that. For too long. 

I guess I can start with what I find wrong with myself, with my appearance. I think that's a big part of it. I know I'm ugly..but it goes deeper than looking in the mirror and cringing..I feel ugly. This might sound jealous and selfish..but it's unfair that there are people out there being attractive and then you can look at me. Ginger hair. Terrible acne that never seems to go how many times I try. I have glasses, my nose is too big, my eyes are weird, my face is chubby...my body is fat, out of proportion. I hate myself everytime I have to look at myself. I am the ugliest male on the planet. I just want to claw my eyes out..rip myself to shreds because I'm so imperfect. I look at other boys my age..with good looks and healthy bodies, with muscles and the like...and I want to be like them. I want to have a girlfriend..I want to feel liked, adored, admired, by a girl. Why is that so hard to happen? Why did I end up like this? I will never find love because of how I look..nevermind how many times I try and impress girls with my personality, intelligence, talents etc. they will never ever ever date and go out with someone as ugly as me. What is the point with so any other attractive people out there? I wouldn't date me. And I've tried to change my appearance..I've tried willing myself to lose weight, to get fit, to go to the gym, to dye my hair, to get contacts, to keep using lotions and acne tablets, to learn to LOVE myself..but that doesn't work. Nothing works. No matter how hard I try. I don't know how much longer I can keep going..before I crack into a million pieces and just give in to hating myself.

It runs deeper than looks too. I'm so ashamed of myself. I'm supposed to be a MALE..I'm 16 and basically at adulthood...yet I cry and cry at the simplest thing. I'm too emotional, too sensitive, I'm not what MEN are supposed to be like. I'm not the embodiment of manilness..and I guess I will never feel that way, as explained earlier. I have no confidence whatsoever..at all..I guess I put up this veil, this facade everyday, to make myself feel better and not worry about everything..as a temporary device to keep me distracted from all these troubles. I put on the biggest smile I can muster, I MAKE myself laugh and laugh and laugh. I MAKE myself be the class clown..the jokester of the group..in a way, I suppose that's me trying to make people like me. Everyone likes someone who's funny right? No one likes a boring, unsmiling person who sits in the corner without talking or anything. But what I just described in that sentence is what I feel like inside. I'm too anxious, I'm too worried.  Everything I do, it's too appease people. I worry about the slighest things...I obsess about what clothes I wear, how my peers at school will percieve me. Everywhere I go, I feel like I'm being judged. I can stand there in the street..and I will notice, I will think, that every passerby is looking at me and laughing in my face..their eyes...I know they look at me and feel repulsed. It's the same in school..I'm conscious about everything. When i answer a question, I start rambling because I'm worried about my answer. When I'm invited to a party, I obsess over whether not to go or to go. Ii usually end skipping it...just in case I find myself in a situation I can't cope with...I think that something anxious will happen..that I'll be embarrassed. It's just me. How I feel. 

I'm lonely..I don't think I have friends.. people don't like me..I can just tell. I'm annoying, hyper, grumpy, too loud, too caring of what people think me, too uptight, too not people's person. Last year I had 'friends' in Year 11 of School, but I felt empty inside. I felt lonely in the crowd, in the group. Nobody counted me as there 'best friend' or someone 'they could trust'. I remember most lunchtimes I could stand or sit there..just listening to everyone elses conversation because nobody ever engaged me..I was just ignored, I was never spoken to unless they wanted something..even when I joined in, they never really spoke back and gave me weird looks. I guess I was the straggler..just tagging on to this group because they paid me some attention once. It was made up of boys and girls..and I thought at the start that they liked me. I was wrong. I remember how I would never recieve messages from any of them on any social networks, Ii would never be invited anywhere whilst they would invite each other..I don't think I've had someone knocking on my door asking for me for about 2 years. I tried explaining myself to some of the girls, to explain how I felt. They only said that i was being stupid, that they did LIKE them and I shouldn't think that way. I'm not an idiot though..it was a lie..a big lie..they knew that people didn't like me, but they never had the heart to tell me. So I carried on regardless, trying to make them like me. Some moments were heartbreaking though..like my friend I had a crush on never ever messaged me or talked to me, despite her insisting I was her friend. She and my other so-called friend had a fling, and i was so pathetically jealous. I still have feelings for this girl and I don't think they will ever go away. But back to these moments, maybe they will help you understand how I'm feeling. I'll paint an image for you. Me at Prom..without a date, having to go with my sister in a car with her friends because nobody invited me to go with them...turning up to see all my male friends in a car together...I go sit with them and they all talk to each other but never to me...they go outside for a bit and I follow after a while, only as soon as I get to where they are, they walk right past me and right inside. I wasn't wanted. That was clear enough. Then began the summer holidays...probably one of the hardest times to get through...without social contact, without having friends. I left my school without any. They never spoke to me once and now I'm in college, they are all still friends and they never even say hello to me in the corridors. It's like I don't exist..like I'm a ghost they tried so desperately to get rid of. They suceedeed. 

Then there was someone I considered my best friend. I thought she liked me, that we would still stay in contact after school broke up. But she hasn't contacted me once..and I've tried so many times to arrange something but she never puts any effort in..I can tell she doesn't want to speak to me. She wants to erase me from her life too. 
Since I couldn't get any interaction socially in my real life.. I basically turned to the virtual world. I befriended people over the internet..a group of them who were all friends..at first, everything was dandy and fine. Ii thought I had found people to talk to, people who I could count as companions even if I never met them in real life. They were there more than anobody else had been, and only a mouseclick away. How wrong I was..a habit I'm getting into. I noticed the same trend appearing..nobody ever messaged me, but they all seemed to share jokes between themselves about chats they had with each other and etc. I brought this up once and they basically turned on me..saying that I was just attention-seeking, I was being stupid and they did like them. I had another one of them tell me to stop complaining and that she doesn't like talking to me because of what I'm like..and that she said she should have listened to everyone's advice in the first place.

I wanna know what I do wrong..there must be something in me, that people despise. I've tried listing everyone of my flaws and I've come to the conclusion that I was probably born into this world to be hated. That's my purpose. 

There's other stuff too..my family. I know they hate me. It's hard to admit this, but I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel loved or cared for. Sure, they provide me with food..clothing..shelter..gifts..entertainment..but that's all superficial love. I don't know why my parents chose to have children..I can tell I was an accident. They hate me. They do. Everything I have ever done and everything I will ever do will be looked down on. Everday I get bombarded with comments like ""your useless"" ""lazy"" ""never do anything"" etc. My parents aren't parents. They never show any real LOVE. I look at my aunt and uncles and my cousins..there family seems happy. They do stuff together, they watch TV together, they eat together, they do day trips together..my family doesn't do any of that. My dad is not a dad to me.  He never did anything for me..he despises me..he never played sports with me or anything like that..probably another reason I came out wrong, why I don't fit in. He will shout at me for the slighest thing..full blown crazy shouting..accidenantly drop a cup? leave the door open? leave the light on? tv up too loud? leave bag on side? He's very threatening..very loud..very angry. I don't feel safe around him. He's hit me so many times..and so has my mother. I told you I don't feel safe. They are violent and whenever I try to defend myself verbally, I'm told I have a temper..that I'm weird..that I'm not normal.. that I have [insert problem here]. My dad has never shown an ounce of love..he hates everything!! They've attacked me a few times..not like a casual slap but full blown punching and that..and when I do anything in return, they say I'm violent. I wanna do something about it..but I don't want to lose them too. I've told myself a few times to go to my nan and grandad and tell them what is happening (my nan understands what my dad is like) but I never get the courage..I know they would just laugh at me and tell me to stop overreacting..or my parents will get there first and paint an image of me being in the wrong. 

My dad and my sister have bullied me too. How silly is that? Do you believe it? It's horrible, my own relatives find it funny to laugh in my face. They can spend entire nights ripping me apart with verbal remarks and laughter..I guess that's what I get for being ginger and fat and ugly and everything. Ridicluled. I suffered with bullying from kids at school too..and even STRANGERS on the street, people who have never met me. They can walk past me and laugh and mutter ""ginger"" or something along those lines. That's when it hits me harder the most..when random people on the street feel the need to hate me..I know I should be hated if this happens.

If they found this, people would laugh. So much laughter. I would be attention-seeking. I would be overreacting.  I would be a liar. Maybe I am? Maybe everything I do is twisted, maybe everything is my fault and that's why people do this to me. It would make sense. 

All these problems..I feel dead inside, like I will never find happiness. I feel like I'm descending down a spiral..getting darker and darker. I feel trapped and everytime I feel like I'm getting out, it's all just a farce and I fall deeper. I want to know if this is normal..if there are other people that feel this. I've contemplated suicide..but I'm too much of a wuss to ever do that...I'm too much of a 'cry-baby', Ii'd never be able to do it. Hell, I'm scared of walking alone in the dark, why wouldn't I be scared of suicide? Ii think this is my penance..my punishment...to exist as a person that is hated and that who I hate myself.

There are problably a thousand other things I forgot to mention..this is all pathetic, stupid, dumb, but I needed to put this into words.

Motivation is such an elusive thing sometimes. I often used to feel that there was just no point in doing anything and that there was no point in being happy because I knew it wouldn't last. I don't think I was quite suicidal but I was definitely into just sitting and staring at the wall, for hours, waiting for the time to go by. 

My family finally convinced me to try medication and let me tell you, it changed my life. I suffer from depression caused by chemical imbalances so with meds, it was incredible. I found myself smiling all the time and talking with strangers and finding excitement in meeting new people. Something I've NEVER EVER done. Now I run for my pills in the morning because I know the benefits they bring me. I'm just not myself without them.

I'm not saying you should get meds. Different things work for different people. Maybe get more sun. Just go outside and sit in the sun.  Maybe exercise.  It takes courage of course, to actually take action, but it was worth it for me. 

Recently I've started to kind of find things that snap me out of it. For example, if I have a bad day, I promise myself ice cream later. Like HOLY SHIT I LOVE ICE CREAM. it snaps me right out of it. Or sometimes I'll go play with the dogs at the animal shelter. Something that always makes me feel better. Or at least get my mind off of how miserable I feel :)

I don't mean to talk so much about myself but I feel so much better than I ever have. I want you to know that it doesn't have to be awful. You'll still have down days, but it just makes the not awful days that much better.

Seven years of doctors, teachers, parents, and friends telling me that it will all get better. That one day I will be happy.

I have a decent amount going for me. I got into my top school and am going into my second year, have the most desired job on campus, not a ton of friends, but enough I guess. And yet the depression is still here.

It's hitting me especially hard right now because the girl I have loved since I was in middle school just left me about a week and a half, two weeks ago. We were broken up going into college and I spend 7 months to win her back. When we were back home for summer break, I did have her back. And I fucked it up. I was so worried with how she acted toward me and what she thought of me/us that I forgot to appreciate what we had. So with a week left of summer, she left me and said that she thinks things are ""100% over this time"". She's back at school and having an incredible time now without me, and leaving me doesn't seem to have phased her much at all...

When all of this happened, thoughts of suicide started immediately popping up into my head. I think I'm too much of a pussy to actually go through with it, but it was still bothering me. And I focused on coming back to school. Well, I came back yesterday and I woke up feeling as empty as ever. I spent the entire morning thinking about suicide. Again, I don't know if I'd actually do it. I probably wouldn't. But this endless pit of depression is really getting to me. And it's not just from the breakup.

ive been depressed (diagnosed once) for awhile now and was fine until about 4 weeks ago. I usually go through random states of depression and then have good weeks, but more recently ive been having down weeks. my (used to be best) friend, the only one i can tell everything to, left me for some girl. he tells me that hes not replacing me or getting rid of me, but still does (intentional or not i dont really know but what does it even matter). and usually i could talk to him about stuff but he is the problem thats fuelling my depressive state. if i even bring up how he is killing our friendship he gets defensive and comes up with some bs excuse that will turn the blame away from himself. to him, its never his fault, its always somebody else; and in my case, i am the one who is being negative towards him when i bring up his actions that hurt me, when really it is him who is being the bad friend. hes happy, im not, and i dont want to lose the friendship but he is (intentionally or unintentionally i dont know for sure) driving a wedge further and further between us, so im starting to lose hope in even trying to be friends with him.

I'm really bad with words but I kind of want to vent since I have nobody to really talk to. So basically I'm gonna write down my story and if somebody takes the time to read it, or if someone actually relates to me and want to talk, please do.

So let me begin from the start. Apparently I am a person of extremes. That means: when I want something, I get basically obsessed with it, because I want to succeed. I want to succeed/ be good at what I do more then everything. It is all I care about, I do not want to fail m yself.
This shows like 2-3 years ago when I started to go to the gym. I was tired of being skinny, and  I decided to train hard / be focused so I could actualy improve. I didnt want to be like an average person that goes to the gym. I wanted result and I wanted it more then everything. It worked to an excent. I went from being skinny to being muscular ( not extreme, but enough to make people notice it + I felt better aswell. gained like 7-8kg). After +- 2 years I got a bit tired of always training/ doing the same shit + I discovered League of legends through friends.

At first I started playing with friends. I didnt like it too much that I was the worst player, well in fact I hated it. I wanted to be the best, not average. When I reached level 30 and I noticed there was a ranked ladder, I immediatly got hooked on it. I wanted to feel better, I wanted to be better then my friends, and nothing would stop me. I tried and I tried, I failed, I improved, and so on.

The next thing was basically that I played alone more, and It got to the point that I didnt want to play so much anymore with ""my friends"". My desire to become one of the best was more important then some random normal games with ""friends"" that looked down a bit on me anyways. I mean like they were not mean or anything, Idk its hard to explain but I wanted to be one of the ""leaders"" in  my friendgroup you know. Not just some average dude they know, and if he can play its allright, and if he can't play then we won't miss him. I don't know it is hard to explain but basically when I dont feel important I'd rather just avoid people/friends. I do not want to be average/ below average, I just can't handle it.

So yeah, back to league of legends. I kept playing alone, avoided my friends for the most part, and grinded hours and hours. In the meantime, in real life it was like: basically the same friendgroup: yes they asked me sometimes to go out/ or do whatever, but basically it was just the same if I joined them or not. It was like fine if I was there, but they woulden't miss me or ask me the day after like ""damn you should've come man it was fun blabla"" I was basically, just an average friend that joined to party/to hang out once in a while. I felt like nobody really was interested in what or how I felt or whatever.

At this point I went out with them like 2/3 times in a month, and it was fun but I realized that these were not longer my ""friends"". They were just guys/girls I know. That's it, just people I go out with once in a while.

So, basically I stopped going out with them, I avoided playing league with them because it is/was mostly awkward. As  you can see basically, I avoided all social contact, I had some other friends from other places to, but yeah not a single REAL friend. Now, I have nobody and i'm just awkward doing nothing but being on my computer the whole day. I can't go out because 1) I have no friends left 2) I can't contact just people I know cuz it would be awkward as fuck and I still have my pride so I do not want that. 3) Even if I would go out with SOMEBODY, it would be awkard as fuck since I have nothing to really talk about besides league.

Oh well, I guess i'm gonna end this long, chaotic post here. I just want to hear some other opinions since I do not want to say this to any person I know.

I have been battling depression for about as long as I can remember, but was officially diagnosed, and medicated, two years ago. After countless sleepless nights, panic attacks, anxiety and pure self loathing, I went against all my instincts and sought help. I was sent to CBT, counselling, and even some questionable assessments at psychiatric institutions, and no one has ever helped me.

You see my problem, is that no one has ever seen me as a girl. As a child, I had many girl friends, and that was fine, but as we grew people started calling me gay and questioning everything that i did. In my head I was just me, but to everyone else I was a boy. This resulted in me spending my teenage years, going to school, returning home and watching tv. This was a great escape from me but when that ended and I was sent out into the real world. that was no longer an option. My life feels like a bad movie, like Freaky Friday, where you look in the mirror and feel like a stranger. People expect things of you as you are a 'male'. The way i think, speak, act, dress people all insult me for and keep calling me gay. In my head I am a heterosexual woman. But to the world I am not. I am transgender.

No one has ever helped me with this, and it's been killing me for years. I will never have a 'normal' life. A normal relationship. How can I? This is an overwhelming problem with which I have had to deal all by myself and its impossible. I go to work, and am so self aware, that everyone sees me as a male, even though I do not feel that way and it's the most emotionally and mentally disturbing feeling. I have thought about killing myself countless times. It crosses my mind everyday. How I would do it. Where.
I have to work, and when I do it barely covers my rent and food. I have no extra money to even begin to pay for whatever changes I can even dream of having done to myself. I worry that one day I will just snap. but i want to live. I want to help other people, and I don't want to die. I want to experience the world and its beauty. But no one understands me and how could they?

I have no future ahead of me, except for growing into a miserable freak :( I'm sorry for the rant, but It's 1 am, i can't sleep and I don't know if i can do this for much longer.

If you are to find happiness, do you want to find it in things that come and go or in something permanent?

He seemed different then other guys or at least i found he had this maturity and confidence about him that i normally don't see with other people. I tried really hard to try talking to him and making small talk and eventually i got up the courage to message him over fb, giving that i didnt have a phone at the time. I felt that we hit it off, we talked all night and eventually i admitted that i had a crush on him a couple days later which he already knew i did. He then went to say that we should maybe hangout and see how that goes. The first time we hung out was after he closed on a saturday night about 130 in the morning, seems like a booty call but i swear it wasnt like that. he picked me up and we went on a cruise in his car and he told me things really personal things about him self, he told me that it was really easy for him to talk to me and that i wasnt like other girls. Our friendship grew instantly, we started hanging out late at night till 3 in the morning sometimes. He drove me to mcdonalds at 12 at night just so i could have a cheese burger. Then he finally asked me on a real date and this was probably the first real date i have ever been on. it was perfect. Then this is when things started going wrong, i had asked him to hangout with me and some of my close friends and me being a bit immature i got drunk pretty fast, i was starting to get extremely emotional, jealous he was talking to my other friends and anxious because i was nervous to find out if he liked me or not. when i started to cry he told me he liked me and that i shouldnt worry. He took my forehead and laid it against his. he asked me if i wanted to go back to his place instead and just sleep there till morning and so i did. That night i had believed i was the luckiest girl in the world, that i didnt believe that this was real or that this would last, but it did happen and so i  went for it. i started to put all my trust in him, i started to trust that he too cared about me and wanted something more. But i shouldnt of done that. after this event he started to continuosly remind me that he wasnt in the right state of mind to date and that he wasnt ready. i am not going to say why only because i do not want to somehow reveal his identity, but u have to trust that i am being honest and that he was doing this for himself and he had things to deal with. But i consistently felt the need to blow up in his face. i felt that he didnt care about me and that i didnt believe he liked me. I was so worried i would loose him. The last night we hungout he told me the most heart breaking thing, he told me that he had been in many situations just like the one i was in. that he would take other girls on dates only to limit them to being friends as well. I was confused and completely heart broken. I had grown to believe in false hope. I knew i had to end things between us before i made things even worse for myself. i felt like a lost dog chasing my own tail. One sunday night i expressed how mad i was and that i couldnt do this anymore that it was too hard for me. That was the last time he asked me to hangout with him still and i said no. He said he was sorry about what had happened. a couple days later i messaged him changing my mind, but he had also changed his. he stopped talking to me, like really talking to me. And as much as i tried to get him back i knew what happened was over between us. I started to get extremely depressed and at some points suicidal as well at that time two of my close friends decided to also cut me out of their lives. But i could never really call them true friends from the start, but now i had no one to talk to except for my parents who as loving and as accepting as they were i found it hard to talk to them about having suicidal thoughts. I found it as my only option and my only excuse to message him, as he had also gone through  rough patches in life. I reached out and he said he would be there or atleast he said i could talk to him when i needed it, however when i did try to talk to him again he just did not care. He told me i was being annoying and immature. After that i stopped talking to him as hard and as painful and as hurtful as it was i still had hope that somehow he might talk to me again. The worst part of all this is that i work with him and its hard to see him, or hear him, or make eye contact with him. and its just overwhelmingly awful i avoid him at all costs. this situation happened about 5 months ago. and though i can fake acting like nothing is wrong deep down i still have feelings for him. But i know i need to let go, but i dont know how. I just keep thinking there is something i can do to change things or make him change his mind, i just want to tell him how i feel, but i dont see the point. we were never meant to be together anyways. He  has always been a really popular kinda guy and im pretty hipster and artsy, but he was the first person that ever thought i was cool or meant something to someone or that i was special and its so hard to put him behind me.

Back story first I suppose. I'm 21 and at a major university. I was always deemed as some kind of great guy with unlimited potential, but my 2nd year in college brought about a level of challenge that I had never experienced before. I began to stop sleeping just from the sheer anxiety, and eventually it led me into severe depression; I didn't eat for about a week and hadn't left my apartment in nearly a month. Towards the end of the semester, the realization of my situation hit me and I attempted to take my own life. I've spent the last year trying to take control of my anxiety and depression with limited success.

Now to my current issue. I've felt alone my entire life and my biggest reason for being suicidal was the feeling that absolutely nobody cared about me. This semester,  I reached out to an old friend just looking for something I could look forward to. She has been more understanding of me than anyone and genuinely cares about me. The feeling has become toxic, though. I can't get enough of it. I'm utterly obsessed with being around her, and starting to develop strong feelings towards her. Unfortunately,  she's not single. She's in love with a guy she's been dating for a year, and it's starting to drive me crazy. When I'm with her, my depression is significantly better, but my anxiety skyrockets. The opposite happens when we are apart.

It feels like I'm stuck. If nothing changes, the swings will only become more and more severe. If I cut ties with her, I'm worried I might become suicidal again. I'm too terrified to talk to her about this.

Sorry for the wall of text, just really stressed about this and it seems to only continue escalating.

Something my shrink (not really a psychiatrist, but I get a kick out of calling her my shrink haha) told me once that sometimes helps... when you feel yourself getting bummed out, instead of fighting it and getting pissed off that you're losing the fight, stop fighting and embrace it. There are times when we need to let the emotions happen in order to figure out why they are there. The process of understanding oneself is like peeling away the layers of an onion. Just when you've finished figuring out one thing about yourself, you realize there's something else. I'm not saying wallow in self misery all the time, but I feel it's important to let the wave overtake you and figure out why the wave is there in the first place. An example... I have a nice 6 hour drive as a buffer between my parents and I. Getting back to see them has been a chore in the past, and even more now that I've got a family of my own. Several years ago, I would make a point to drive back for at least one of the big holidays, Thanksgiving or Christmas. Every year, regardless of which event I attended, I would come back to my home and be depressed for 6 weeks. At first I was upset that I was depressed and tried to fight it. After a few years and a few dozen therapy sessions, I realized that I'm getting depressed because I don't want to return to visit my parents. At all. Holiday or not. The dysfunction is too great for me to deal with. I would get depressed because that's all the family I had, and I wasn't being fulfilled by being there. There's no law that requires me to physically visit them. So I stopped and the depressed eased. I wrote them letters and explained some things and they accepted my decision. It was liberating to not feel obligated to do something that made me miserable.

A quote that I find fitting when I'm having a hard time... 'When you're going through hell, keep going.'

138969,,True,Allergic2Ferns,,,,"Sounds a bit like my life. I'm a 28 year old virgin. Never had a girlfriend, but I've kissed one girl.

I've almost always been socially awkward and had few friends. Near the end of highschool I gave in to the peer pressure started cigarettes, alcohol, and smoking a lot of pot to fit in. For a while it was kinda nice to be more social, but now 10 years later I find myself struggling with depression again. I had a breakdown and was unemployed for 1 year while my parents supported my recovery, but now I've been employed for 2 years and am feeling better. My job pays shit but it's gives me time to think. No health insurance though.

I can relate to the alien thing. I've had social anxiety for most of my life. I think a lot of it has to do with being surrounded by people I really don't relate to, and sometimes it's hard to imagine anyone could ever feel the way I do. It helps to remind myself that there's something like 8 billion people on the planet.

I never made it far in college, because I felt pressured into making a decision I really didn't feel comfortable with. Although people tend to look down on me for working at a gas station, I'm really not impressed with many of them either.

My virginity used to devestate my confidence, and I always had a fear that if people found out, they would think I was pathetic. Nowadays It bothers me less. I see so many fake relationships I just feel bad for most of them. Guys who are afraid people will think they're gay if they don't have a girlfriend. People getting married just to fall apart. People so afraid of being who they want to be, I just feel bad for most of them.

I don't want to do it forever, and it may sound pathetic, but I really got lucky with this job. I deal with hundreds of people a day, but for very brief moments. It's really helped with my social anxiety. It's also given me a sense of other people's personalities. You'd be surprised at how intimidating a calm attitude can be to some of these assholes. Fake people can get real jealous of somebody who's comfortable with expressing themselves. I see so many dressed up dollfaces, it doesn't even make me nervous anymore. Most of them are just to insecure to leave the house without make-up. Every once in a while though, I'll see a girl that makes me want to better myself, and I'm glad I don't sell myself short by pretending to be something I'm not.

Anyway, I got a bit carried away. I'm glad I came across your post. I was planning on writing something similar. I refrained from trying to cheer you up by telling you everything is going to be fine, because I can't stand it when people tell me that. Not to sound selfish, but for what it's worth, I feel better.",,0.0,,2012-04-08 07:21:02,,,0,False,,,,0,,c49r4r5,,,,,t3_ryvjl,,,t1_c49r4r5,,,,t3_ryvjl,,,,,,,,1428677567.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

151850,,True,[deleted],,,,"I don't have it as bad as many people here but I've been dealing with an oppressive religion on my shoulders for about 7 years. At least those are the years that it has felt truly oppressive. I'm 25 now and the last 2 years have been the worst. About 1 year a go I finally questioned everything and came out the other side an agnostic atheist. I feel more internally consistent now, which is good, but everything has changed. I've kept literally 1 friend from before my apostasy and have been dealing with family drama as well. 

Throughout all this I ate a ton. And have recently started drinking a ton. I barely did anything but go to work, avoid doing the work, come home, eat pizza or some massive burrito or delicious indian food, then watch movies and tv shows. These were just my escapes. I don't know how to make friends in the real world, outside of the built in social life the church gave me. 

About 3 months a go I was laid off from a decent job in an industry that was very interesting to me before my entire view of the world changed. I now have absolutely no interest in that field. So I'm going back to school, like you, to try and make something of myself and find a passion or purpose to help replace all the meaning destroyed by my loss of belief.

Anyway, I say all this to set up what has been working for me very recently. Since I've confronted my depression head on I've focused on small things first.

#1 If I dont do anything else all day I force myself to exercise for at least 30 minutes. 

I know this can be incredibly difficult for people to do. I couldn't do it for a long time. But the last week I have felt much less apathetic and a little more hopeful about my future, however uncertain it is. I'm still not happy. I'm still depressed. But at least the exercise is helping me avoid, or at least keep in check, my more destructive coping mechanisms - over eating and drinking.

#2 Be around good people. 

this one is more difficult for me. Being an introverted, depressive adult whose social life has been outsourced to a religious institution I no longer believe in makes being social incredibly difficult. But I've found a small group of other disaffected people to hang out with once or twice a week. Even though they're not perfect friends it's still good to just be around people, laugh, make stupid jokes and watch stupid tv shows. So finding people who will just accept you and where you're at right to be around might be a big help in just helping you feel better about life and finding more motivation and hope.

Implementing these two things have really been helping me find a new, happier path for my life. Im by no means out of the woods when it comes to depression, feeling great about myself, having purpose and motivation in life, but I feel like I'm heading in the right direction. I hope my thoughts help in some way, even though my advice might not right for you.

181885,,True,MooMorris,,,,"I had a friend in a similar situation; woke up early afternoon and played games online all night. He also lived entirely off his parents (he lived with them). When something like school work had to be done, they would confiscate his consoles and take time off work to make him do it. He even quit a job after one day because it affected his gaming.

It appears that it's a system of bad habits that lead to depression:

- It isn't natural to have a sleeping pattern like that and he'll be doing all sorts of damage to his psych. 

- Lack of daylight is a killer. People don't realise how important vitamin d is in mental and physical health. I physically forced (as in grabbed his arm and pulled) my friend out of his house on more than one occasion to get him outside, because his parents were doing nothing.

- Lack of exercise will do physical damage that can lead to confidence issues. It also means that he's not getting endorphins which make people happy.

- Social reclusion. If he stops going out people will stop inviting him out which will make him lonely. This happened to my friend, and it hit him hard.

- Anxiety can become an issue because doing things like going outside becomes unfamiliar and therefore frightening. He'll also forget social norms which may make him stand out and he'll become anxious.

- If his parents are providing everything, where's his need for motivation? He can seemingly live to a comfortable level without doing anything. This was crucial for my friend. Being given a car, driving lessons (well over £1000 worth), shelter, food and money for games meant he had no need to work for what he wanted. Other factors touched upon meant he didn't want a girlfriend or to move out.

My advice is talk to your friend now. Make him do things he doesn't want to do. Hide his stuff if necessary. 

It's been two years since my friend finished university. He has applied for two jobs in that time and the amount of times he's left the house for a social reason can be counted on one hand.

3657,,True,DerangedGoblin,,,,"I'm sorry it's been so hard. I just read something in a book about the difference between being a upset or having a breakdown versus being actually depressed. The guy said the difference basically came down to how you felt about the future. If you felt like this was a really hard time but that it was productive and was leading to something or would end soon then you were just upset or having some sort of breakdown. If you felt like there was no hope and any time someone offered advice you instinctively shot it down then you were depressed.

I don't know how accurate that is, but assuming it is I think maybe it's good news. It means this isn't your fault, it's potentially an illness. I don't want to push this too hard because I know how a lot of people feel about depression as an illness, but as someone who went to the hospital for just over a month while the meds kicked in (And I'm one month away from being off them completely now) I really believe that they can help if you go through some sort of thherapy or something in the mean time. 

What I mean is, while I've been on the medication, I've taken a mindfulness approach to my depression, finding the causes in my personality. I know that I'm prone to anxiety and I'm a bit sensitive to insults because I'm desperate for approval. When I come off the medication, I plan on using that knowledge to help myself through whatever ""blips"" might occur. If I have an anxiety attack and start to get really helpless I'll just calm myself down and say ""I'm not really reacting to a situation that warrants this, I'm just acting based on habit,"" or something similar. 

My point is that no matter how you feel about depression medications, if you're planning on killing yourself then they're worth a shot, and I'm saying that as someone with experience.

13315,,True,mcknuckle,,,,"I cannot stress this enough: you've got to learn to dig yourself!  Seriously.  Not egotistically, but like you would someone important in your life that you look up to and that you love.  Be someone that you are proud of and can admire.  See yourself as someone that you are proud of and can admire.  And you can do that just by changing the way you think moment to moment, you don't even have to start putting pressure on yourself to make massive changes in your life.  Just make a commitment to start thinking positively about yourself one moment at a time.  If you forget and stop, just start again whenever you notice.


Start being your own best friend.  Seek out things that make you really happy, not just fake, temporary happy like drugs/alcohol or other unhealthy behavior.  Realize what your own interests and uniqueness are and learn to really love those things about yourself.  The more you do that, the more you will have to share with other people.  The more you have to share with other people and the more excited you are to share what you have with other people, the more trouble you have finding time to be by yourself.


I've had very similar feelings and experiences to you and the OP for most of my life.  It took a very emotionally destructive experience for me to finally realize that it sucks being unhappy and that I alone can change that.  I now spend probably 75% (if not more) of all of my time by myself, but I can't remember the last time I felt lonely or depressed about a lack of friends or girlfriends.  


I spend time by myself because I want to spend time by myself and because I genuinely like spending time by myself and when I don't there are almost always more than enough opportunities to spend time with other people.  That's the great thing about people, they like to do that.  If I do feel like hanging out with people, but no one's available for whatever reason, I'm never left feeling down about it or depressed and with rare exception, I never fail to find something else to do that I enjoy regardless.",,0.0,,2010-05-23 04:20:48,,,0,True,,,,0,,c0qkgqw,,,,,t3_c6xj6,,,t1_c0qkgqw,,,,t1_c0qjq5e,,,,,,,,1426316879.0,,2,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,2,,

Honestly though, I really don't know where to begin with this one, or even understand the point I'm trying to make...

So here's just a bit of background information about myself. 20 year old male college student (doubt my gender is relevant but I feel the need to post it), not many friends/no friends I can talk to at the moment, literally bugger all to do all day.

Some may not call what I've been experiencing over the last several years ""depression"", but then again, the majority of the people I know probably haven't gone through what I have and simply can't understand how much of a toll certain events and circumstances can have on an individual.

Without going into to much detail (short and sweet, remember!), I feel like I've lived a pointless/wasted life. I don't have that many friends that I can talk to about certain topics, so I guess the anonymity of reddit is is the only way I can express myself.

In a nutshell, I literally have no life. I'm not really sure if I ""struggle"" to make friends (I don't know because I don't meet new people all that often), but I definitely have problems maintaining friendships. It appears that the issue I have is that I'm too nice to people and the only time people actually acknowledge my existence is when they want/need something (which I've experienced a LOT in college, mostly when people need help with assignments). 

I'm not like others my age, so it's difficult for me to even start conversations with people without a common interest. I'm different in the sense that I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, listen to the same music as everyone else etc. Also, the majority of people within my area are generally unfriendly and try to put on a ""gangster/thug life"" facade in order to fit in, so they probably aren't the kind of people I would want to be around anyway.

I don't have any way to productively spend my time other than browse the internet and stay in bed all day playing Pokemon (no joke!) I don't have many hobbies aside from occasional gaming, nor can I afford to try new things that I might end up enjoying. I don't have a stable/consistent form of income, as my job only offers work when there are certain events, and there have not been any events since May! This feeling of laziness has left me feeling very confused. Am I depressed because I'm lazy? Or is the laziness a side-effect of my depression?

Don't get me wrong, I want to be productive. I've let my laziness control my life for too long. It feels as if I have no motivation to do ANYTHING, despite wanting to. It's like a dead end for me and I can't really figure out why. There's so much I want to do or have tried to do, such as cleaning my room, exercising or learning to develop games, but each time I just have this feeling of sadness (or at least it feels like it) weighing me down.

What should I do?

Little things too, I just don't keep doing what works.  I was always like this, I kinda just thought I was lazy.  But I wanted to do better.  I really wanted to put in the work and succeed.

The hard work isn't the same as theirs and success isn't theirs either.  It's a sore back and a summit.  So I'm working to work in the parks.  To do what I want.  I stopped judging myself by their standards.

But they haven't.  I am still a failure.  I'm not free from their judgement.  My (now ex)girlfriend has left me.  She's the one who saved me when I wanted to take my own life.  And now she sees that I don't have a future that fits with them.  I'm called immature.  I'm reminded that I've failed so often that I'll probably fail now too.  And to be honest I feel that coming but I don't know how much of that is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  

I want people around me. I just want them to stop judging me.  I want them to know that, by their standards, I intend to fail.  I want them to be there despite that.  I always wanted people to stop asking things of me because of how often I let them down.  It used to be that I failed that depresses me.  Now it's that they call me a failure.  It hurts more this way but I don't know if it's because it's not the comfort of an old and familiar hurt.  But I have my refuge in the wilderness.

Many people sufferring from depression are able to get through the work day or the social event or whatever by keeping it below the surface, because having someone draw attention to your depression is horrifying and panic-attack inducing.   If I'm able to coast through by focusing on my work, having someone ask ""Are you okay?  Is something wrong?  You seem sad.  Is there something I can help with?"" is the sort of trigger than cause a flood of emotions that were safely under control.    I've seen too many people who were managing to get through the day but who collapsed when naive, well-meaning others decided to jump in.     

  
Having another person poking at the places where it hurts you does several things:  it makes oneself-conscious and extra attuned to the pain--something he or she probably wanted to avoid.  It validates the negativity by externalizing it.  Suddenly, it is real, because other people are noticing it.  ""Now I'm the guy who's life is so shitty that a random stranger even noticed it.""  Etcetera.   It can actually exacerbate the problem if the problem is rooted in social anxiety.  ""Now everyone is going to know that I have this problem.  Word is out.  I'm going to have the reputation as the guy who with the mood disorder.""    
  
Conceivably, the depression you notice in a stranger might actually come at the best part of their day, not the worst.  It could be even worse when they go home and it's their only companion, such that it was under control and they were functioning and coasting when you intervened.  But by you jumping in and calling attention to it, you've ruined their period of relative escape.  
     
I'm speaking from personal experience.  Before butting in, you should realize that some people feel as I've just described, and you may be making things worse instead of better.

And i'm not in a financial situation where I could afford any kind of therapy regardless, so i'm not about to seek something out that I'm not sure would make a difference.

I don't even think i'm depressed -- in the clinical sense of the word at least -- just, kind of really lonely and isolated feeling, with no end in sight.  It struck me last night when I was walking back from grabbing dinner and I saw all sorts of people walking down the street in costumes, never by themselves and going somewhere to have fun no doubt.  That that's not my life, and except for brief phases of it never was.

I moved to New york City a few months ago to attend school part-time at a small college in the city.  I thought moving to a place with so many people from a place that didn't have even 1% the population would be a good thing as I'd be immersed in more social interaction by default.  But it hasn't really worked that way, at least not much more than a marginal difference.  Everyone here goes out with groups of friends and don't seem keen on talking with strangers.  So a lot of days I just kind of hate myself, end up sleeping in until 2pm in the afternoon, getting fucking nothing done while sitting in my apartment messing around on the internet, and ordering food in.  These ruts are starting to happen more and more and its affecting my grades now too, which is really, really bad.  And it feels worse cause when I was living in bumfuck Georgia, I could justify it, but now that i'm in one of the most active cities in the world with so much to supposedly offer, I feel like i'm just wasting my life.  I sorta kind made like three friends the first month or two here but as time has gone on they've faded out -- even though I texted them to set things up -- so that sucks.  Sometimes I feel like if you can't be used to network or aren't a super even driven career chasing go getter, that people view hanging out with you a waste of time once they figure it out.  Don't talk about making friends in my program, which is tiny, and most of the students are older and commuters from outside the city, with families, etc.

I suppose my issue -- or issues, again I have no idea what exactly is wrong with me -- is a huge inferiority complex.  Both a physical and lifestyle one.  The physical one is easy to explain.  I grew up with a metabolic disorder that I won't go into -- suffice it to say it stunted me for my adolescence.  Until high school I was the smallest person in my class both boys and girls, and was in something like the bottom 1% for both height and weight.  Surprisingly this didn't make for as bad a childhood as you think, but it did keep me from ever being involved in any group sports or childhood crushes or anything of that manner, and I was always an easy target for ridicule just because.  I don't think I can totally attribute my near crippling shyness that I have to this day because of it, as my father is also really a shy person and I feel like a lot of it has to be genetic.  But it probably did affect me in a underlying psychological way I can't quantify.  I was so withdrawn with the two or three childhood friends I had that I never really gave much opportunity for other kids to hassle me that much anyways.  Of course its kind of a double edged sword because being so anti-social really set back my social skill development, I have no doubt about that.  In retrospect I realize my parents probably over-sheltered me as I never really did much in the way of extracurriculars growing up that would team me up with other kids.  But I didn't realize it at the time.  The take away is that during adolescence I had it psychologically ingrained that I didn't belong physically or socially with kids in my peer group.  Which I suppose is why I seemingly only got along for the most part with kids 2-3 years younger.  I mean, I was really sheltered that until high school I didn't even know the most basic pop culture stuff.  In 7th grade, kids were getting blowjobs from their girlfriends?  Me, I literally did not even know what a blowjob was when I heard the term.  At 13.  That should give you an idea of how sheltered I was.

During high school I was treated more thoroughly for my disorder by my specialist and started growing.  Instead of being the smallest in my class I was at least now bigger than most of the girls and 2-3 of the guys, though still well below average, just not freakishly so.  I came out of my shell a little, and felt more comfortable with my peer group, even kissed a girl for the first time though nothing close to a proper relationship, let alone date.  College was good for the first year or two, kissed another girl -- though again, nothing beyond that -- and made a few friends.  Unfortunately things started to fall off a bit after that.  A common pattern of my life is making an initial decently sized friend group, and then having them fall off one by one until i'm left with one, and eventually zero.  This was no different and the last two years I really only hung out with two people in mostly isolated situations.  Moreover, I started to fall behind again physically.  Even though the disorder treatment helped, it probably permanently stunted me so I topped off at 5'7 and 130 pounds.  Worst off, I had and to this day have a baby face -- can't grow a beard to save my life -- meaning I look approximately 16-18.  This is especially bad as around the time I stopped growing I reached the age where women in my peer group stop liking ""boys"", so to speak, and only go for the typical masculine archetype guy.  You know, strong chin, big muscles, 6ft tall, etc.  Graduating made things go bad to worse, because even though I wasn't really interacting with them, the amount of young eligible women I was exposed to went from lots to very little.  Likewise, very few guys made age to make friends with either. 

As for my lifestyle inferiority complex I mentioned earlier, that didn't start to rear its head until after I graduated from college, but it's bigger than ever.  I open facebook and everyone I see is *doing* something.  Going to med school, traveling abroad all throughout europe, doing some fellowship in LA, Chicago, San Francisco, etc.  Acting.  Business.  Art.  Either way getting well established in their career, and here I am with all to show for my entire life one shitty job I had for a few months.  Add in the fact that I haven't had a real relationship, a virgin obviously, and don't go out that much and I'm basically ten years behind all my peers in life experience.  And i'm getting to the age now where that becomes really, really weird to the point i'd die if anyone found out.

So here I am in New York, in school again, and I feel more ""inferior"" than ever.  People here are a lot more beautiful and look conscious than in Georgia, that's for sure.  Seems like every other girl and guy I pass in the street is model looking.  I've seen so many 6 foot tall, square jawed, built guys -- and their female counterparts -- walking around that I just assume i'm some sort of anomaly now.  Like, the average guy here is legitimately 6 feet tall and good looking.  And of course like I mentioned earlier since people come here to work in the top of their industry, everyone is about 1000x times more accomplished and richer than me when it comes to their careers and extracurricular stuff like volunteering, community involvement, etc, with a full social calendar.  You know that expression that says we shouldn't compare our behind-the-scenes to everyone's highlight reel?  Well, i'm pretty sure most people's behind-the-scenes here don't involve spending their nights watching netflix, reading, and eating hot pockets by yourself over and over.  I tried heading out to a bar to meet people and it was a disaster.  Like I said, everyone here goes out in groups and does not want a stranger butting in to their conversations unless they're with a group, and I didn't even bother approaching any women there when every other guy in the room was 4-10 inches taller, actually looked their age facially, and probably had a real life to talk about.  They're not interested in talking to someone who looks 16 and scrawny with nothing going on in their life.  I'm not a bar/club type of guy to begin with so I don't see myself doing this in the future.  The brief time I attempted online dating I pretty much gave up after looking through the competing male profiles on the site and also seeing how much better than me they were.  I'm not even sure where I would meet women otherwise if not in those two venues.  Like I said I made a few friend just through a few fitness things I was involved in but that seems to have faded away with the end of those events, and we never were friends on any sort of meaningful level.  So while everyone else here has stuff to do and people to do it with, i've regressed again to spending 98% of my time in class or my apartment.

The thing is, i'm not even a bad conversationalist and have a good sense of humor, but going beyond simple courtesy talk to try to initiate things, whether a close friendship or date or something, just isn't in my repertoire.  Seems 100% natural to everyone else, but whatever instructions those people were born with I just didn't get.  Whenever i've made friends in the past it's always been in a forced situation like living in the same dormitory or seeing each other in class day after day for years at a time.  I feel like I could have a decent social life if I ever got past the initial steps of working my way into a social circle and getting comfortable with people, but I can't even get past that first step of meeting people.  I almost wish I could just hire someone to coach me socially and get me out there and connected with people beyond small talk, because I sure as hell can't do it by myself.  Like, I don't even know what the first step would be.  So it's basically as bad as having no social skills at all.  I mean, I know it's possible that people move to cities and quickly develop social circles, but I can't help but think that those people are some combination of normal looking, more accomplished, and already have a base of people they can connect to, to work with.  I continue to feel like that inferiority complex I mentioned, in addition to my lack of just getting out there, is why i'm in this rut.  Why I can't get into a situation where it would be appropriate to approach and ask out a girl for the first time in my life, or why I can't just go somewhere social like a bar and make friends.  

My main questions are, one, is there some kind of inexpensive therapy that could even begin to fix me?  I kind of doubt it to be honest.  Two, is there such thing as a social coach -- god, this sounds pathetic -- who can help get you out there?  I really wish this type of thing existed.  And three, is there any way to know how big of an anomaly I am?  I'm sure there are at least a few others in the world in similar situations and it doesn't make a difference in my life, but somehow just knowing a percentage would help, as weird as that sounds, and also if they ever got out of it and succeeded.

Are any of you on disability? Virginia, if that's helpful.

I just feel myself slipping further and further, and on Halloween I turn 25. When I was younger, and called it ""my ennui"" instead of depression, I always felt that by 25 I'd either have my life together or be dead. Neither have happened, and instead I'm a NEET living at home with my parents, and my bills and garbage is piling up. My family is toxic to me and they don't even realize it, and with my brother and my sister in law living under the same roof, the place is getting cramped to the point that I'm afraid to leave my little belltower. I can't even afford the doctor visits or the medication that I've been cycling through trying to find one that works, and I'm *constantly* reminded of the fact that I can't afford it and that I should be grateful that the people triggering all my depression are paying for the medicine while reminding me how dependent I am.

I feel like I'm juggling a bunch of crap, or more accurately carrying it. And I just need something, some sort of pillar, to put at least some of it down on. I don't like the idea of ""disability"". I don't like the idea of getting that label slapped on me that says I'm broken. It's the same feeling I had about admitting I was depressed. But the fact of the matter is, I am broken. And I can't fix myself if I'm juggling social, financial, sexual, familial, and not-living-in-filth-ial chainsaws.

tl;dr: I need to get out of my house and away from my family and start paying my bills. Disability seems like my best option.

The therapy option is the very least you can do for yourself--think of it as a salvage operation, if you like. Or repair: just as you had for your jaw, your knee--something's broken and it needs some professional attention. And not all your future options pop up like targets in a pinball game; you have to keep walking down the road to see what's there, where you want to go, and the path to get there.

I think Saatchi and Saatchi was and may still be the agency of record for Toyota. 

I know it's painful, I'm still going through a lot of shit myself post-graduation, I found family who would help me. I'm back in school for a second bachelor's. You're not down and out until you're dead. In the meantime, check out PeoplePerHour and try doing some small work. A few small bucks is a few small bucks. Designing logos for four or five mom and pop startups at $35 a piece adds up to over $100, though I'm not sure the cut the website takes. Don't force yourself to stay where you are for a few years hoping to start it fresh later, it never really pans out.

Lastly, say fuck it and go anyways to the ER. If you're that concerned your mother will find out go when she's not working. If they prescribe anything, ask for a generic (and if they want to put you on anything that doesn't currently have a generic refuse). Flush the percocet, there's no reason to keep them and it's an addiction you don't want to have to deal with considering everything else in your life.

Also, if your mom is handling your student loans, she sounds like she'd be the kind of person to buy your plane ticket if you had to take a job elsewhere. 

1. You're 27. You're at the end of the first quarter and the score isn't looking too good. Three more quarters to go brah. 
2. Any reason you can't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare?
3. Tell your mother you need professional help. 
4. Take jobs on PeoplePerHour - a few bucks is a few bucks. 
5. Stop thinking you need to stay where you are for a little while but will then start fresh. It doesn't ever work that way. I really agree with the guy you responded to, your area doesn't seem like that kind of area where you would succeed well. 
6. Work on your portfolio in your menial time, work on your website as well.
7. Try to get out of your house. Go to Panera or something and do some work, follow graphic designers on Twitter, and don't just follow, interact. It's part of your job.
8. Did you keep in touch with classmates who may give you a foot in the door if where they work has an opening?
9. Check out sites like Newgrounds and other sites where you could sell art. Hell, try and do commission work if you can. Just because you don't have an employer doesn't mean you're unemployed. 

A lot of it is going to be tiding you over, but try to find small jobs like PeoplePerHour, your current job, do commission and freelance work. If there's a local college or university, put up notices saying you can tutor in Photoshop. 

TL;DR: You have more resources than you think you do. You'll have to take a non-traditional, unorthodox, strategic approach to success. Maximize all your small options to tide you over: this helps keep you busy and your mind off negative things.

My partner and I get along very well and have a lot in common. Lately however since my depression has worsened it has distanced us somewhat. I feel like things will start to get better for me soon as my coursework is coming to an end so I will have more time to focus on getting myself better. In the meantime however, I've been really down a lot of the time lately. When I spend time at my partner's house often I will vent or unload my worries and problems on him, sometimes crying and just generally feeling shit. This isn't helped by the fact that he has usually been working all day and doesn't want to do anything but relax, whereas I just want to do something to get my mind off things.

He is not very good with offering words of comfort or knowing what to say, and that is fine, I don't expect it from him. He also has never dealt with depression closely before and doesn't understand why I can't just get over it. However he realizes that it isn't as easy for me to do that as it would be for him and tries to be as understanding as possible. 

Lately I know my moods have been getting him down so when we see each other it isn't very fun at all, especially because I've been unwell lately.

I know this cannot continue and it's unhealthy for my relationship. I hate the fact that I'm dragging him into my depression. He's opted to spend time alone rather than with me recently because he's the type of person who likes to be alone at times, especially when he's feeling down.

I need to get myself out of this rut. But when I see him and we end up doing nothing it just gets me down more. I was thinking I should not vent my problems to him anymore because he doesn't need to be burdened with them. This is hard for me though because he's the only person I have in my life that I can talk about this stuff with. It does hurt a lot when he says things like ""I'm not usually the caring type, you made me care about you a lot but when you are constantly making me down it makes it hard to keep caring as much"". 

I'm just wondering if there's anyone out there who's been through something similar to this, and if so how did you deal with it?

Next time I see him I'm going to try my best to be as positive and fun as I can, and organise to do something nice together.

I care about them, yet i can never explain everything that's going on. I'm sorry for typing all this you probably don't or didn't read it all anyway.

I did tell him various times that it hurts me when he wouldn't call me for weeks (I was abroad during those times for professional reasons but called him and stayed on skype as much as possible), because I know I can help him . 

For instance he was feeling guilty about having to leave the country the same day I arrived and didn't tell me for a week (and was really anxious during this whole week) but I was totally ok with it, I understood he  has other obligations. If he had talked to me earlier, it would have been much easier.
 So maybe telling him that he hurts me when he doesn t call, or tells me that I cant be of any help or avoids me could be the thing you mention. Eventhough I decided from now on I would be stronger and stop complaining  
Also I tease him about him about no taking initiatives like cooking dinner but never agressively or seriously, always with benevolence. But now that I think of it he may take it as something i seriously reproach him, instead of gently pushing him so that he feels more capable. 
How do I help him feel better about himself and feel like he can accomplish all the things I know he can if I my encouraging fails  ? 
Do you think any of those things could have the bad effects you mention ?

21929,,True,Carpen,,,,"1. I didn't realize that what i was experiencing was depression until it was really bad. I got to the point where i didn't care about anything. I didn't want to do anything. I didn't hang out with anyone, my schoolwork was never done, i didn't eat right, i gained weight, and immersed myself in video games to ease the pain. I don't think i had a moment where i realized it but when i did, everything i had experienced started to make sense.  

2. When  I was diagnosed, my family was EXTREMELY supported. In fact, they helped pave my way out of depression. They tried to make sure I took my  medicine and stayed healthy. Before I was diagnosed, my parents knew something was up and always tried to see what was wrong. But of course, I brushed them aside because I just wanted to be alone.

3.-4. My depression really took hold of my life in high school. I had been bullied pretty severly. See question one for some answers to this question. 
   Besides what I have already written, I didn't go to any school events, out in public, with friends, or anything really. I didn't have many friends then because i  just closed myself off to people. I guess I didn't want to be hurt/ I just wanted to be left alone. 
   I  began to cut myself which really began to worry my parents.
Depression just made me feel small, unimportant, and detached from the world around me. I immersed myself in books because they were always there for me and they never would hurt me. I am so glad that i read so much. I became a fly on the wall at school and in life. I observed, so as not to make myself open to interaction with people.

  Depression make me feel like others didn't like me. I probably pushed away many people who were trying to be my friend. 
   I always thought people were going to or were talking about me behind my back, and that people were always messing with me/ making fun of me. My attitude to people was usually pretty discourteous and rude because i thought THEY were trying to be mean to ME.
  During this time my OCD also got very bad again. Having my nose broken by my best friend caused me humiliation and i became a bit paranoid. I was afraid that he was going to do something to me again. Anxiety was prevalent during this period and permeated in to many situations.

5. Were I to explain depression to someone who had no idea what it was, i would tell them this.  Imaging feeling sluggish all the time and you feel like nothing mattered. There wasn't much that could interest you, and what does interest you is fleeting. Nothing can give you escape from the feeling  that there is seemingly no point in ANYTHING. Imagine wanting to lay in bed all day, not because you're tired necessarily, but because you feel no reason to gt OUT of bed.

6. These day things are much, much better. I'm in college now and most of that stuff is behind me. My parents got divorced last year which cause a relapse in most everything I talked about. But anyways, my psychiatrist gave me tons of help with the meds he put me on. Talking to people about what happened and processing it all in my head has helped me immensely. 

I feel still sometimes that a few years of my life were stolen because of this illness.

I feel like i became so serious and didn't have fun or enjoy high school in ways that i had seen others experience. 

Finding friends who cared about me also made all the difference in the world. Maybe i should have found them earlier. But, no matter what, i feel like what i have gone through has made me a stronger person.

If you have any questions about anything feel free to ask!!

I wear a sleep mask.
I turn off most of the lights at home by the evening, so that I get more adjusted to the dark. 
I turn up the heat so that it's warm and toasty (it makes me more comfortable when I try to sleep). My heater also works as a nice white-noise maker.
I only take sips of water after 8pm so I don't have to go to the bathroom late at night.
I try to some book or textbook until I start to feel drowsy (note: I don't read in bed, rather I read at my desk so that I only use my bed for sleeping).
I've found sandwiching my head between two pillows (while turned on my side of course) puts a little bit of pressure on my head and for some reason helps me sleep better.
Although I haven't done this everyday, sometimes I'll turn off my computer earlier at night so that I don't end up surfing too late into the night.


That's all I got, but I hope it helps. If you feel like your sleep is affecting your daily functioning in either school or work or whatever, I'd suggest telling your therapist that if you haven't already done so. Good luck trying to catch some Z's.

I am not going to repeat my backstory up to the point of my last post; there is deliciously scandalous reading there that you would feel ashamed for missing. :)

I'll lead with a bullet point summary and then dive into details:

* I've spent the interval between posts lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and playing video games.
* I've reduced what few social contacts I've had, and burned a bridge or two for good measure. 
* I've made a small amount of contact with the mother of my children. We've spoken a little and she's given me some updates on them, but she refuses point blank to allow me to speak to either. 
* I took heed of a recommendation and arranged to see a therapist via my doctor. She was completely useless, and did nothing but repeatedly cut me off and ask me what I thought would let me walk out of there happy. I did not return again. 
* More self-harm. 
* Still not on any medication. 

I had high hopes after my last post, as I felt some inertia to get out of bed and get going. It lasted maybe three days, before I went back under the covers and continued to shun everyone. 

And boy, have I shunned everyone! I've slowly and systematically started to destroy all traces of my online life; gone are my Facebook, Twitter, and Google profiles, along with several older forum and social accounts. I have one relatively close friend from *World of Warcraft* whom I speak to a few times a week, and two friends from outside of the game who I engage with maybe once a week. Beyond that I have no contacts, no friends. So there's been a net reduction. 

I've entirely given up on speaking to my family about depression; my mother is convinced I can be cursed in whole if I just get a job and engage with other people, my sister would like me to sit down, shut up and simply resume a normal, and my brother, while sympathetic, is basically a narcissist. 

I've swapped some emails with my wife. She's declared she's done and through with me, and refuses to allow me to speak to my children; my wife cites my temper and volatility in the past, and the effort she sunk into allowing me contact, which ended in violence, and with the eldest (daughter) in therapy herself. I don't even know why she's in therapy; no one will answer questions my questions about her.

Emotionally, I tether between a precarious hope that I *can get out there and do something tomorrow*, and soul-crushing self-hatred because I tried and failed. I've dabbled in some creative panorama work in World of Warcraft, but that lost its lustre after a few weeks. 

There have been two instances of cutting after moments of stress and failure, and knowing that *that* is waiting for me if I fail again has added even more reinforcement to my reluctance to engage myself. College is a complete, acknowledged write-off. I've been on the campus on fewer than ten days out of one hundred and thirty-odd of the school year to date. I have no idea what I am going to do with my life come September. I won't qualify for a grant to repeat, and I'm not sure I even want to. But, honestly, I don't care much. I've convinced myself I won't be around then to have to worry about it.

I'm 17 and in my last year of high school, and lately, everything's been going downhill. My parents, who are in the middle of a nasty divorce, are both awesome about a third of the time and fucking awful the other two thirds. My mom acts all nice and understanding but is *constantly* lying to and deceiving those around her, and my dad, who I realize is going through a lot right now, will completely fly off the handle and lose it over almost anything. He's never hit me and I'd be shocked if he ever did, but boy does he love to yell at me and blame me for anything he doesn't want to deal with himself.

I have straight D's in school right now, and I feel like a lot of the colleges that accepted me or probably would accept me are going to change their minds when they see my grades from this semester. Sometimes it makes me feel miserable, but a lot of the time I don't really give a fuck because I'd much rather stay at home and sleep than deal with that shit.

Along with that, I've been treating myself like shit. I don't really care about what I eat or whether or not I do anything active. I still shower and groom myself before going out in public because of the reasons I'll explain in the next paragraph, but I've been gaining weight and I'm already a bit chubby to begin with.

Here's the kicker. Things haven't been going well but I've somehow stayed at least a little upbeat, up until I met this girl. I've never met a girl who I've liked anywhere near as much as this one. She's cute as hell, open minded, shares my sense of humor, and likes all the nerdy shit I do. Like if I tried to draw a blueprint of the perfect girl for me, it would be nearly identical to her. Problem is, while I haven't made a move on her beyond flirting, she's been sending me strong signals that she doesn't feel the same way I do. The last straw was when she texted me earlier about this guy she liked from her old state (she just moved here), who she had a brief thing with and is now infatuated with again. She only semi-sarcastically told me that she wanted to marry him. That may not a sure-fire sign that I'm not getting anywhere with her, but as far as I'm concerned it's close enough.

So I've already been feeling pretty down and depressed, but this girl's effective rejection of me has basically pushed me over the line. All the other shit making me feel awful, and now this? It took me 17 years to find a girl I *truly* wanted to date (I can be a bit too picky for my own good) and felt like I had a shot with, and boom, I get nowhere. I feel like fucking shit. The logical part of me knows that I'll probably get over her and find someone else eventually, but the emotional side of me doesn't give a single fuck, especially with all the other shit bogging me down. I don't think I want to kill myself, but I feel like if I went to bed tonight and never woke up, I'd be alright with that.

So there it is. I feel like I may be forgetting something, but whatever. Half the time I feel miserable and half the time I don't give a shit about anything. I don't know what the fuck to do.

7210,,True,undercurrents,,,,"this possibly applies to most people, but not to depressed people. If you read any depression study about optimism versus realism, depressives far outscore non-depressives in predicting the future more realistically, attributing problems to the more accurate cause, accurately assessing the state of possibilities and success, perception of events, etc. You can read through the diagnostic manual, Bipolar and Recurrent Depression Disorders, 2nd edition, Gooodwin and Jamison for multiple studies like this.

That being said, it's not exactly a good thing that depressives more accurately reflect reality, because another conclusion from numerous studies show, ""the state of depression is characterized by a gross alteration in cognitive schema, reflecting diminished or absent self-serving biases in the depressed state."" In other words, depressive become hard wired for negativity, expecting failed outcomes, and giving no recognition to themselves for success.

So basically, since most major studies show the depressive brain becomes literally hardwired for states of hopelessness, helplessness, and futility, you posting this article on the depression thread is sort of like saying (though I know you didn't intend for this), ""the *normal* human brain is hard wired for optimism, too bad yours isn't.""",,0.0,,2012-01-02 06:10:47,,,0,False,,,,0,,c3d5wys,,,,,t3_ny4jm,,,t1_c3d5wys,,,,t3_ny4jm,,,,,,,,1428110299.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

I am not panicking or anything this conversation for me right now is as if I were discussing the weather with someone I just met.  So for me this is what I would call a rational frame of mind.  I'm sure by the end of this there may be thoughts otherwise.  Also its freaking late so I have no doubt there will be plenty of errors. Eh so what.

This may get long winded.

I have what most would consider a form of depression I would assume.  In the past I have attempted to take my own life, and have had several self injury moments over several years worth now.  Lucky me most have gone away with only a few stubborn scars.  My thoughts have developed recently that, if I would want to just end it and get out of the way for other people, why not?  
Now I don't plan on anything tonight, let me get that straight.  But they way I see it I really don't want to fight this fight any more.  One solid up hill fight just is not worth it sometimes.  And don't give me the it gets better, I have tried to listen to that from way back when and so far it has not been a true statement.  College is constantly making me stress, girls are near impossible, and friends here are more shallow then a puddle after a morning rain.  I just don't get it sometimes suppose.  And yes, I realize that is no reason to end it, but it sure doesn't help.

So I don't ramble or just vent to much B.S. on you guys when you are all trying to help people out, (which to all of you, you are awesome beyond words) I just think that it would be easier to just leave.

It's hard to say truthfully that the feelings get better with time, but I can say that I've learned to deal with it so much better with time. As will you. My biggest advice to you is this: whether or not you feel like you'd want to interact in large social groups and can't is another story; but if you feel intimidated by them and it doesn't even seem appealing to you, then don't try! And stop caring if people think that you're a ""loner"". Chances are, when shitty people are flocking to the big groups of people just to be in the big groups of people, someone will notice the cover of that book you're reading, and become your best friend based off of a true interest.

Also, I didn't have a bunch of friends in college, but the friends that I did have came when I realized I had something to offer someone, and then I went out of my way to do so, and did that continuously. For example, I was really good at Bio in high school. My freshman year I made a huge study guide and distributed it to the class to help everybody on their finals. People started coming to me for help with that and other things, and then I got a small, tight-knit group of friends. . . And I liked it that way.

You sound to me like you're a bit too hard on yourself. Some things you cannot control. You can't control how your ex behaved; unfortunately, there are individuals out there who think about themselves more than anyone else. Yeah, it's going to hurt quite a bit, but time will make the memories fade and you'll find a nice lady who accepts you for who you are...and who knows, she may be the one for you.

As for the STDs, I don't have to tell you to get them checked out and taken care of ASAP. That's a given.

As for the job, that would be a bit easier to remedy. I am certain having Apple on your resume will land you a fantastic job soon. It may not be what you want, then again it may be 10 times better than Apple. Start sending out your resume now!

For your alarm situation...I can guarantee because you have been so stressed, you have been getting a shitty amount of sleep. Try to sleep about 7-8 hours a day (try not to go over 9). It definitely helps with depression. Over the counter meds like Melatonin can help, and I take Trazodone to help my sleep. See if you can arrange your bed so that it faces a window in the morning where the light of the sun will wake you, or aim a mirror so that the light will hit the mirror then hit you in the face. (if you have a window in your bedroom). There are many more helpful hints to resetting your circadian clock and getting decent sleep, but I'll let you google them for yourself.

As for today, I want you to just chill out, watch a funny movie and try to forget everything for just one day. You are under a lot of pressure now and a day to just decompress can help you so much, and it can be life-saving. (I always get chided about having a heart attack by the time I'm 30 because I'm such a hothead. I'm 27 now.) Have a day for yourself, gather your thoughts, write down your plan of action, and get started on it first thing tomorrow.

But god damn is it a succubus, it will tear your life in half like the brittle little bitch you are, and it takes so much time and energy to get rid of it, The mental endurance is so necessary and intense, For 7 years I've been dealing with depression, 

At this point it's almost as I am not a person, but the depression is, it took over, To explain it fully is impossible, you really have to feel it. It's almost as if you are back-seat driving, with no one else in the car, and you have no way of changing the speed, and only sometimes the direction. And when you try to do anything for yourself, you are punished with self-hatred and remorse, lest the mental incapacity to do much of anything. And when you let it be and try to not to do anything? It still fucking kicks you in the shins and gives you a knee to the face, leaving you down for the count every single day.

You love your depression, because you are depression. You let it get away from your grasp, you don't have control, you have nothing, and you are nothing.



But there is a secret this succubus doesn't want you to know. She can be defeated. Don't let her in, or kick her out. You can win, and you can become everything that she wishes to take away from you, you just have to stand up to her and say 'fuck off', and go on with your day and enjoy it. And it is too late for me, but please try your best to push her out.

I dreamed that I was on a trip with my ex-wife, before we got married.  In the dream, I suddenly realized that I had gone back in time by about 6 years, but I still had all of my memories from the intervening time.

Realization #1 - I was going to have to quit smoking again.  What a bitch.

Realization #2 - I wouldn't have my awesome computer yet, which I purchased about 6 months after the divorce, when I realized that being single again, I had more money than I knew what to do with.  :-)

Realization #3 - I COULD FIX EVERYTHING!!!  I began making plans.  As soon as we got back in town, I was going to kick her ass out, and tell her I never wanted to see her again.  I was going to do it gently, but firmly, since at this point in her timeline, she wouldn't have had any idea why I was choosing to break things off with her.  Then I was going to settle in to wait, and focus on becoming a better person, until the day came around that I would have met my now current wife.  I could have avoided so much heartache, so many bad decisions.  I could have done a lot of growing up.  Having vastly improved myself and my outlook on life, I would have met my new wife, and became the husband for her that she deserves, and been able to give to her the life that she deserves.

Then I woke up.  I was disoriented for a few moments, looking around trying to figure out why I was back in the present, instead of in the hotel room with my ex-wife.

I know the entire thing of that there is always someone worse off than yourself, but blimey how much stuff needs to happen to me :(

How is your relationship with your parents?  Can you talk about any of this with either one?  I realize it's a scary thing to suggest -- you're probably rolling your eyes and saying ""They wouldn't understand"", but it might help if you can pick one thing that you're unhappy about and talk about it with them.  They just might surprise you :)

Why does your friend think this guy is bad for you?  It could just be that she thinks you'd be ""settling"" too much, or it could be that he would be an unhealthy boyfriend.

Counseling would probably help.  I know it probably sounds weird and scary to set up, but think about it.  A good therapist will have a better idea of what to say than just ""that sucks"" :)

I feel like an utter loser. Everything that I touch seems to fall to shit. I started a business 2 years ago - still haven't made enough to pay myself, just breaking even. Before that I did content writing, managed to make £8000 a year for 5 years - not even a living wage. Before that I got a degree - that's good, but I haven't done anything with it. Before that I dropped out of another university, before that I went to college, before that I was sacked from 2 jobs, before that I dropped out of college. 

As you can see, I've never had any success. All of my friends have money and are successful, and I'm just shit. At weekends I spend all day in bed. My freinds go out, but they never invite me to the fun stuff, they come around for cups of tea (British, lol), but all the fun events they don't want me there, I think. 

I only have 6 friends and they don't invite me to stuff, so I feel like I have no friends. No life. Nothing to do. 

I have a boyfriend, but he's getting dragged down with me. He was strong and happy, buy I can see my black cloud chipping away at him. 

Oh, living arrangements are shit too. Parents moved away when I was 17. I went to live with someone who was basically a user. Then I got a bf, who hated the guy I was living with, so it made the situation worse. I got a flat, which was nice for 2 years, but no one would come and visit me except my bf - I thought people would want to come round. Then I went to Uni, dropped out and had to live with my bf's family. I was a total mess and couldn't leave the room - didn't even wash for days on end. Eventually they said 'she's outstayed her welcome, don't you think'...so that's more rejection and me sleeping in my car. Then I got another flat, and I've held onto it for dear life. 12 years in a dark dingy flat that I never open the curtains to. Finally, I'm getting a house - this is good news - a whole house that no one can take away...unless someone decides to sue me. This latter point brings up fear of the company going bust and the creditors taking my house before I even get it.

From my point of view I'm a child. I can't hold a job that brings money - I've never really done that (the sacking, the low wages, the business being bad). The unstable homes. This is screaming to me that I'm incapable. That I'm unloveable. That noone likes me. Noone wants to have fun with me - I'm not on any list of priority (except my families and my bf, but I need the fun side of life too). I feel like a complete and utter loser. 

I used to think it would all work out in the end, and these were the teething problems of youth. But I'm 34 now - that's a whole 17 years of non-stop fuckups. 

Given this background I have zero belief in myself. I think I'm better of dead, because I can't live a life like this forever. I look at everyone else and they're off on holidays, getting married, having babies and making money. And I'm just a big pile of poo. 

Anyway, is this depression talking, or am I just a fucking loser. How do I stop being a loser when I can't beleive that anything can ever get better. The future is full of the bleakness of the past.

But here we are. If you are willing to read my long story and say something that will either harshly wake me up or gently support me, I would be grateful.

Although I didn't recognize it for what it was for years and years, I probably started developing depression towards the second half of elementary school. Nothing traumatic happened to me. But, rather, I was probably just quickly disillusioned by the world. All the naive trust and hope I had were quickly betrayed by backstabbing and bullying.

I hated people in general. I was almost always home alone -even on holidays such as Christmas, my parents would be out with other people instead - year after year. I also found out that the one best friend I believed in actually hated my guts for what she felt like as ""doing better than her in everything and having her family love me more than her"". Which I didn't believe to be true nor was I trying to outdo or replace her. I felt alone and the world turned grey.

Soon after, I moved to somewhere where no one knew me and it was a chance for a fresh start. I felt a liberation and immediately took up the personality of someone who I wanted to be: social, carefree, a little wild, and almost saintly in love and patience with others. But of course, not all of that was the real me. It was merely a projected image and careful chess game. On the outside everything was great; I seemed to have made friends, the general school population has heard about me and knew me as the hilarious -albeit a little weird - and all-loving one. But it was tiring trying to be the epitome of carefree happiness and trying to take courses of actions that are the most selfless all the time. I would laugh and laugh at school but when I got to my empty house I just cried and cried. I wished somebody would see through the mask and genuinely care enough to ask me ""Are you okay?"" and tell me from the bottom of their heart ""I just want you to be happy. Please stop crying.""

And on a certain day, it happened. After a certain talk and after I had acted strangely I received a call. The voice on the other end asked ""Are you okay?""

I still remember it so clearly. I felt like it was the moment I had been waiting and longing for most of my life. I cried and poured my heart out. This person listened and comforted me. And very soon, this person became my pillar of strength. And as I got to know her better, I couldn't help but to fall in love. I've never been so touched or shocked by someone who cared enough about me and my happiness that she would cry for me. Someone who wouldn't mind having me as her burden. Of course, this became the start of a new problem as I was a female in love with another female who was uncomfortable about other types of sexual orientations aside from heterosexual. Although it was a little painful, I was still at peace as we were close and I was no longer alone.

Fast forward to university. The one moment where I felt so alive and every emotion at the same time... shock, happiness, fear, helplessness, hope... It was the moment she kissed me and told me she loved me. I didn't even think that that was a possibility. It was the purest form of happiness that I had ever felt for the next few days. The world burst back into full vivid colour. I felt like I did it. If life was a game, I had won. I got what I wanted from life: someone to love completely and someone who loved me completely. Of course we had our rough edges, but we were so convinced that they were just small things to smooth out together. As a matter of fact, at the height of my happiness, I felt a scary emptiness. I had achieved all I wanted at the age of 18. What now? It all feels so empty - not in a sad way, but kind of surreal.

Of course this happiness did not last long. She was still homophobic and letting the world know about us was not an option. I was told that either we forget the past four days of bliss and carry on like nothing happened or that I be prepared for great pain because when our relationship is at risk of being found out, it will have to end. Of course, I chose the latter. I found my purpose in life and I didn't want to let go. I believed that with time she would come to accept. 

But it never happened. She also became disillusioned as our relationship was not completely perfect. We've had some ups and downs. While I felt like it just made us a stronger pair, she felt that if it was right for us to be together, we wouldn't have so many troubles. She also felt guilty that we had to very strictly keep it all a secret when I always wanted simple things like holding hands at the park. I also had my depressive ups and downs too. It killed me a little inside every time she suggested that since I was bisexual I should try my best to fall in love with someone else and leave her. Nonetheless, for me almost three magical years together passed by... and then one night a few weeks prior to our third year anniversary she told me that for a while now she's been thinking that she doesn't love me anymore. There was no future for us as she doesn't think she can ever accept being with another female. And that there was someone else in her life now that she might have a chance with.

And that was that. She still wanted to be friends. She still supports me. She's very tactful when mentioning about things related to her new boyfriend to me. She still tells me she wants me to be happy. Even though I lash out in defense from the pain, she holds me to no fault. I feel like a horrible person. If I truly loved her, shouldn't I just be satisfied that she now has a chance at permanent happiness? I fell straight back into the dark pit of depression. And while I have my difficult spells of despair, she still kindly tries to pull me back out. It drives me crazy that I can't tell anyone why I'm back to the bottom again. It drives me crazy that no one else has a clue as to why I'm acting the way I am. But I intend to keep my promise of keeping our relationship a secret. Or at least anonymous. But I feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about someone else holding her and telling her ""I love you"". I feel like the one thing I wanted in life was given to me only so that it would be harshly taken away to mock me.

I know, I'm still young. What do I know about love? It's just ONE relationship. But I don't see how anyone else can know me better than she does. How anyone else can get through to me as she does. How I can love someone else more than the person who saved my life by showing me the way out of depression. I don't easily let people in. Try as I may to convince myself there will be someone else... it's been quite a while and when I stop lying to myself all I can think about is how love her. How I can't imagine loving anyone else beyond this. If time is the only thing that will fix all this... then how long will I need to be tortured until I'm free? Do I even want to wait that long? There isn't even a guarantee that happiness will come even if I wait out the pain. Not sure what the point of enduring this pain that almost kills me day after day is.

Several suicide attempts, probable AvPD, and a very small group of people that I actually tell anything to.

Recently, I've been switching my antidepressant from Prozac to Effexor (under doctor supervision). I was on 100mg of Prozac (my liver is stupid) and am currently going through withdrawal as I taper off.

I've been bored for a long time, but in a way the suicidality kept me occupied. Right now, I am just waiting to completely be off of Prozac before I make any decisions about my mortality.

But that's not what I'm here for! Going outside pretty much terrifies me. I do it 3-4 times a week to try to fake people into thinking I'm sane. Mostly, I sit in my room bored. I watch Netflix all day while doing other things on my laptop. I've watched through a couple animated comedies ten times or more all the way through. Marijuana always helps, but if I can't turn my brain off while I'm on it, I go down dark rabbit trails.

I like video games, but I can't seem to get myself to play them. Online games just end up with me hating myself. I don't think I can play any serious games right now, or I end up on a rabbit trail that makes me suicidal. Games with a ton of reading are out.

I just want to say I'd never commit suicide because I'm always holding out hope for the future. But, the thoughts are there and it bothers me that killing myself seems like a better option in my own mind than living my life.

I'm in one of those low points myself right now. Suicidal, scattered thoughts. Sleeping way more than I should. Just out of the blue. One thing I've noticed after being on medication for about three years now, is that I still have cycles of extremely low moods. I've heard several other people in this sub say similar things.

As for tips, I don't know how much I can help, seeing as I'm in a similar spot. I've been trying to put mindfulness-type advice to use, but it's turning out to be harder than I thought. :/ A couple of things I do know, though:

1. If you're taking medication, don't miss any doses. In my case, the trouble with missing one or two (not even in a row!) was very subtle -- it was only weeks later than the cumulative (un-?)effect showed up and I was bawling. ._.

2. It's nice to hold out / schedule something you enjoy for the future. Even just on a weekend / monthly basis. I know this is general advice, but it seems to have helped for me. :)

3. Part of dealing with the negative thoughts is just watching them -- seeing them as they come. Often, that's difficult enough for me. Sometimes they just come in waves. I'm not ambitious enough to replace them with positive ones -- just neutral ones. :)

As for anxiety, I can only say I've been there and that my meds have helped. Until I was 22, most of the time I felt like I was getting a stomach ulcer. Around that time, I realized that isn't a normal feeling. After the meds, I'm pretty cool-headed now. Mostly. Oh -- and when I'm having trouble concentrating at work, I try to focus in 15-minute cycles. After 15 minutes of really working on something, if I'm stuck, I let myself take a break for a few minutes, then get back at it. Sometimes it works better than others.

That was more rambly than I was going to be, but I hope it helps. :)

39588,,True,AyeMatey,,,,"I didn't suggest you should not care.   I didn't suggest that you should say ""fuck it"".   Or walk off.  Or abandon them. 

It is one thing to care. It is another thing to own it, to feel responsible, and for you yourself to be stressed that YOU are not solving the problem. 

Caring is fine, caring is good.  Feeling responsible is not. 

What CAN you do?  You can be available to talk. You can empathize. You can be patient. If you have particular insights, you can offer those to them. Other than that, these are adults and they are responsible for their own lives. 

I am not getting the words quite right, but I hope you get the idea. There's a line between care and responsibility. 

------

I'll give you a specific example. I have a friend who abuses drugs. Not all the time.  But sometimes. And he gets into trouble doing it. This is an adult, someone who ""ought to know better"" or whatever.  And intellectually, he knows the drugs are not good. And yet....  He still does them.  He still goes back to them, from time to time, when he's feeling good, and when he has cash to burn. He still talks himself into doing stupid destructive things. 

When he is drugging, he does things that are mean, hurtful, and dangerous. (beyond being criminal).  It's not good for him or the people around him. 

What can I do about this? 

I *care*.  I do.  Very much. I want only good things for this guy.  I see a path that is better for him. He has all these good things going for him. But I cannot NOT DO DRUGS for him.  He has to make that decision.  He has to do that thing, for himself. 

I talk to him, sometimes about the drugs, but mostly not. I talk to him about anything, I do stuff for him, work on his motorcycle for him, gratis.  I do favors for people he loves, only because he is my friend.  I spend time with him when he is not drugging, and just try to share good things in life, good times, you know? Like going fishing or just going out for a pizza and to watch a game on TV. Or talking about a cool book I read. I try to inhabit the part of his life that is good and drug free, I try to enlarge or enrich that part of his life. 

But I cannot babysit him. I don't call him every day and ask ""did you say no to drugs today?""  

I step away from him when he is drugging, because... honestly, it's not my problem. I have my own things to deal with, and I know he can't solve MY problems either.  We both know this.  We're both clear on the lines of responsibility.  I care, but his problem is not my problem. He cares about me, but my problems are mine to solve. 

I'm not saying your parents are on drugs. I'm not saying their problems are tantamount to being on drugs.  I'm saying, whatever problems they have, are their own. It's possible for you to care, and not feel responsible;  to care, and to not seek solutions.  To care, and do nice things, and be helpful and be a good person, and allow the person you care for to solve their own problems.

Let me start by saying that I'd love if I could chat with someone (weird way of starting this post, but yeah). I have this peculiar feature where I absolutely hate / don't really talk much with my closest friends about my personal problems. I've been told that that's really bad and that I'm missing out on life, as well as missing opportunities to bond more deeply. Unfortunately, I really don't know how to do that, since I still feel that it's hard to open up with someone (i mean do you just go up to someone and say 'hey I need to talk?'). Plus, I have mixed experiences where sometimes I feel the things I say about me and the 'knowledge' the other person gains about me is used against me at some point.

Anyway, I feel like being trapped / slump / with a mild depression for 2 months now. I'm studying and living abroad. It all started when about 3 months I started playing more video games (yes - I'm also a video game addict and struggling to recover). At the time I sort of trying for the 1000th time having games and trying to have a balanced healthy lifestyle (hint - it didn't work). I just thought that, by now, with 23 years I would be mature enough to know when to play, when to stop playing, and never loose track of what's important and makes me feel better, rather than being on the computer 24/7.

Bear in mind that I was also living in a really shitty town in the UK. I had a couple of exams to do, and some 1.5/2 weeks before they were due I've moved to a really nice student town, which is nothing like the other place. It has everything I want, warm weather (sometimes), nice, multicultural environment and friendly people. However, in the process of moving, I was indulged by myself and family to look for a proper place (I was on a small room and only intended to be here for a week), look for a part time job and study. I obviously failed to do all of them, I guess mostly because I was depressed, lacking motivation and also was still addicted to the games. I spent countless days in my room, laying in bed and playing games as a coping mechanism, as a way to not deal with the present/responsibilities and whatsoever.

I traveled back to the old town to do the exams, but I didn't have the courage to show up in the examination room, as I wasn't properly prepared and there was no way I would get a pass grad (I'm a decent student, and any passing grade would be enough to have a B and A as a final grade respectively.

At that point I wasn't sure of what to do. I didn't tell anyone what happened, obviously, since I was ashamed. At the same time, I knew I could have fucked up my future really hard, because I didn't know if I could have referrals and besides I knew I would most definitely postpone my masters dissertation. 

I came back to my little room feeling even worse. Now I had to wait to retake the exams and the dissertation was postponed, meaning I could only start doing it officially in September. I also needed a part time job, since I promised my parents I would do it so they didn't have so much of a financial burden with me.

All the while, I only knew a couple of people within the city (which are sort of like family) which I feel like only made me feel even shittier. I, as per usual, moved to another place by myself, carrying my two 20 KG bags, guitar and backpack. Settled down, relied on no one to get here and 'survive', and obviously I still get shitted because I don't know the city properly yet, or because I don't have a easy ass job as they do.

I'm rumbling - what I mean is that I thought I was going to have a little bit more of support, instead of the opposite which almost felt inconsiderate hate / whatever.

I went through ups and downs and finally I decided to stop with games and I'm doing /r/stopgaming. The reason I played so much is also because I really don't know anyone here and while playing (even 70/80% of the time I did it by myself) I was chatting and doing it with my friends back home.

Since then, I spent countless days laying again in my bed; watching TV Shows or game streams just to make time pass by. I also cried, a lot. I cry and sob because I feel incredibly lonely, making it even worse when I remember where I was one year ago (did stuff like Erasmus and worked on a really awesome place in the summer). I also know have people who like and deeply care about me back home, but I don't think I can rely on them that much (either because I don't want to open up, or because i.e. in case of my parents, don't want them to feel bad knowing that I'm not okay).

During those days lot's of things come to my mind, and only makes it worse because I constantly think and feel that I'm dead and waiting for my body to shut down; I imagine my funeral and everyone back home attending it, I sob even more, because I'm thinking that and still weighing if I wouldn't be a less of a burden psychological and physical to my parents.

Anyway, things did get better since then. I made some resolutions, such as finishing this degree (first by studying and retaking this exams), and second by doing a remote part-time job (which is on the field I like, hence I'm happy about it). What made this year so bad was the deception that was this new degree I wanted to take, as well as being in such a shitty place. I was struggling in the past weeks trying to decide if I should pursuit it or not, considering the unbearable amount of pain and problems it has brought me. It's hard to put it in words, but let's just say that I feel that doing this was one of the worse decisions of my life (provided, the decision was mine and I should've studied the options more carefully)  and that also set me back considerably, since I was doing so well last year, academically, professionally and socially.

Now the reason I'm still writing this is because I still have 'breakdowns'. I don't feel like I'm normal. I know I have to go out, even when I don't want to. I know I need to socialize, and meet people and so on. And I know how happy I am when I do that, and even more when I feel people geniounly like me and so on. But I still break down, because it's not easy. I've been told that 'life is not easy' and that I need to know and learn how to set a goal and fight for it, no matter how hard is it. That I need to know to know how to get up when I'm feeling down. But still, I don't know how or when I will do it.

I know sometimes I try to much; have too many goals and too many dreams, and fail miserably and feel even worse. That I focus too much on the past, the future and micro-manage everyday instead of looking to the big picture. But I still don't know what it will take for me to 'grow up' and 'buckle up'.

I feel like I've some progress and accomplished some stuff in the last weeks (e.g. 'fixed' my sleep schedule, sleeping 8 hours and waking early; improved eating habits; got a job (which will allow me to cover my living expenses e.g. my parents don't need to support me anymore), even got out plenty of times on my own, and also managed to meet some people on a meetup). But still, today I 'sort of' feel like doing nothing or not leaving the house. Because it still takes effort, to go out, and for example to try out doing these 'social' things which for me, seem incredibly difficult as I am shy, and have confidence issues. For me, going out alone for a drink on a bar / wine place is still a big thing, because it involves so many things.

I just wish it would be easier! That I didn't have to make so much effort and go through some extents to start building a better social life. Or even, changing my internal 'firmware' to switch to someone who wants / needs to go out without so much 'work'. Because I know I'm a social person, but still have these... depression like, cave man rocky instincts.

If you've managed to read all the way till here then you're an awesome person! Anyway - just felt like throwing it out there.

kind wishes

-&gt; I mean I'm just wondering why can't I have a break? Why it seems I have to put so much effort in everything? (I'm a perfectionist, yes, but still - why e.g. making new friends / going out isn't natural or feels so hard when e.g. I'm not on a conference or something that brings everyone to the same purpose). I know I should be grateful for everything I have and am, and that there are tons of people which would love to be in my place. But I also feel like I want to be more, accomplish more - and feel even worse when I see so many people having success or being so independent with this same age",False,depression,t5_2qqqf,self,Getting out of my chest,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2bayxv/getting_out_of_my_chest/,

I feel in control of my emotional responses, instead of my emotions and anxiety controlling my behavior.  I combine my meds with talk therapy as opposed to CBT.  I think that's sort of the standard of care.

For a while I was taking Ativan as needed for insomnia until I got my sleep schedule under control, and now I don't need that.  I also take Xanax as a ""sprinkle,"" although I was taking that more often at the beginning of my treatment.  Now, I haven't touched the Xanax in months.  Both helped me get on track (fixing insomnia does wonders for how you feel, and once I got into a schedule, I was great and didn't need drugs to sleep) and get used to healthier behavior and interactions with other people (I couldn't be in some situations without the xanax, but now that I have excelled in those same situations with the xanax, I've created sort of a pattern of behavior and interaction in those situations and now I don't need the xanax to stay in control).

Recently my doc temporarily switched me from Lexapro to Pristiq because I had a traumatic event recently.  The Lexapro kept helping me with anxiety after the trauma (I was super awesome during this horrible experience, totally calm and in control), but I was thrown into this depressive funk.  My doc says that the Pristiq would continue to control my anxiety like the Lexapro, but it has an extra boost for depression.  I'm very happy.  He says that once I work through my funk I can stop the Pristiq and go back to Lexapro.

Good luck!  Getting your butt to treatment is the hardest part.  It was for me, at least.",,0.0,,2013-01-22 06:14:15,,,0,False,,,,0,,c81bpix,,,,,t3_170g0g,,,t1_c81bpix,,,,t3_170g0g,,,,,,,,1431039776.0,,3,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,3,,

It was promised to me 3 years ago, when she had her first child, that I would be in the delivery room with her when she has her baby. When she had her first child, I was unable to be in the room with her because I was 2 1/2 hours away. She just got engaged to her current partner and now they have a son together. 

I got along with her fiance, even though he hasn't really had the best track record with the rest of my family. The rest of my family doesn't really like him all that much because they think either he is too egotistical or talks too much or has something to say about everything or he is too strict on my cousin's son, which he has stepped up and taken a father role towards her first born, even though he is not his. 

When my cousin found out she was pregnant, she wanted me to be in the room with her, she wanted me to be with her and she also wanted me to help her out. I wanted to help her out in any possible way! I am a professional photographer so I did free photo sessions for her all the time, I even helped her plan her baby shower, I made the invitations, I bought the decorations, I also bought them a lot of baby things. It was agreed that I would be in the delivery room when she gave birth because for one, I've never been able to witness this before, I've been waiting for over 5 years to see a baby being born. Each time I had the chance, something happened. 

While it was agreed that I'd be in the delivery room by her and her fiance, it was also agreed upon that I'd be taking pictures, not only for my portfolio, but also for our family. 
I spent 3 days at their house, I made it to every hospital visit in those days and I did whatever I could to help them out. I had also canceled a trip to a convention I had planned for over a month(She was early on going into labor, she was due on the 26th.) I had spent over $100 in supplies for my costume, my fiance made his costume, in which he spent over $100 on himself, and we canceled because I had to be there for my cousin. 
Today was finally the day that she had her baby. I was there with them for hours and hours. My fiance went to pick up my cousin's fiance's mother, who had arrived from another state to visit and help out around the house for a few days, she was staying at the house taking care of my cousin's first born while we were at the hospital and while he was asleep. 
It gets to the time that she needs to push. The doctors say only 3 people were allowed in the room. They tell my cousin's fiance's mother to leave with my cousin's son, and it's me, my Aunt(cousin's mom) and her fiance. He looks at his mom and starts telling me to please switch places with his mom. At that moment, I told him that I had to take pictures and I was promised this and I hadn't seen a child being born yet. My aunt goes out to switch places with his mom and his mom refuses to come in. The baby is born, the most beautiful thing I've seen, the entrance of a life in this world, I take pictures. Then my cousin's fiance asks my Aunt and I to leave the room while his mother has a moment with them. My fiance, whom had just worked a night shift, has been awake since 10:30pm the night before and it was now 2 pm. We are in front of the door, my cousin's SO decides to open the door and says he'll get us when he is ready in a snippy tone towards my fiance. He gets pissed and says that after picking up my cousin's fiance's mother and all of this, he is going to be an asshole to him? No. He goes down to his car and tells me to hurry up and pack my stuff. I started crying. I hate conflict. I hate feeling like I'm the reason behind ruining events. I hate feeling like I made someone angry. My aunt tried to reassure me and tell me that my cousin's partner is just a jackass and I really shouldn't take it personally. My aunt tries to take her grandson to meet his baby brother, my cousin's fiance comes out, yanks him out of her arms and tells us to leave. He yells at me saying I ruined a moment because of my selfish needs and he said some other nasty things but I blocked them out, walked straight to the room and I packed my things, told my cousin I loved her, and left in the midst of an anxiety attack and having PTSD flashbacks (my parents used to fight when I was younger, so I have a huge issue with fighting and people being angry with me.) 

It breaks my heart that after ALL I've done for them, that my cousin, whom is hard at speaking up for herself as it is on top of just giving birth, has to deal with her family being kicked out just because her fiance couldn't have his mother be in the room when it was never really agreed upon as well as she wasn't even going to be there in the first place! Without my help, his mom wouldn't be there. 

I'm not sure what I should do or how I should feel. But what I am feeling right now is extremely drain and I'm feeling extremely depressed and self destructive mentally...
Is it wrong that I didn't give up my spot??? Is it selfish of me? Is it my fault? What should I do? I'm scared to go back to the hospital to even face this situation again...

i am quite emotionally strong despite being a sensitive guy. when she is feeling her worst she has emotional abusive outbursts. i have always supported her and been there for her in any way i possibly can. we have our good times and our bad times but i love her very much.




A lot of people have commented on her behaviour, stating that i could do so much better than her and her mistreatment and that i put up with too much ""shit"". i think that this would be true to an extent if she was not sick. but unfortunately she is very sick and needs me to be there for her during the hard times.




2 days ago things were fine with my girlfriend, nothing out of the ordinary in her behaviour was apparent. we were planning to spend the day together on tuesday. she was super excited to come over when we were texting on monday night. she specifically said: ""i hope nothing comes out tomrrow so we can still have the house to ourself!""




suddenly at around 10 o clock she was being short and not bothering to engage in conversation. she then said to me, ""somethings come up, i cant make tomorrow and i cant talk right now""she said she was going to bed. i can read her like a book and i can tell that something was wrong. she flat out lied to me about something happening because she is a terrible excuse maker.




in the morning there was no reply to my night message so i sent her a messgae on facebook. just a general one telling her that i loved her and that im thinking of her. she said she couldnt talk right now and that she could tell me what was going on. by this time i was really worried because this behavior is really weird and nothing like any previous depressed behavior. she was cursing which is notable usually when shes in a depressed/angry state.





she told me not to worry and that she will message me when she could. that night at 12 i got a call on facebook messenger, i answered but she hung up so i called again, my heart was aching to talk and i felt so worried. she ignored my call and my message asking if she wanted to talk.




it is now wednesday today, at 4:37 in the afternoon. i mesaged her 2 hours ago asking what was going on. she said ""im not talking about it now so repspect my decision"" she told me not to worry and that is was going to be okay and we will talk when shes ready.




i havent heard from her since, shes active on facebook and i asked a friend who saw her yesterday if she was acting funny and the friend said that she was fine just a little quiet.




im really worried because something is wrong but im being kept in the dark so it really could be anything. i am so worried for her and i havent slept, she says shes fine but i know she isnt just by the way shes been acting.




we havent been at school cause its exam time and i havent needed to go all week, so i havent been able to see her in person. if i keep messging her i know she will have no hesitation in blocking me on facebook and blocking my number so the only think i can do is wait for her to come to me and i guess i have to respect her decision.
at the moment im a mixture of anxious and angry. i feel like my feelings have been totally disregarded and shes totally ok with giving me the cold shoulder. ive told her that im so worried and she doesnt care about the way she is treating me.




i dont know what to do, i dont know what the problem is and i dont know when she will contact me. is it wrong for me to be angry and sort of resentful because shes totally neglected me and my feelings?

So basically me and my girlfriend currently have depression and anxiety, and she has talked about how she doesn't want to live and how she wants to kill herself. It got bad one time before where she said she took pills (I think just to relax her) and I was so anxious and scared that if I didn't get my parents to call her house that I'd lose her and feel like it was my fault for the rest of my life. Ever since that night she hasn't fully trusted me, and one day I went on her Tumblr and it said if she wasn't happier by Christmas that she was gonna kill herself then. I honestly don't know what to do with myself. I've tried convincing her not to because of how much I love and care for her (she's the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Got me out of my depressed whole) but she doesn't believe that I do because she's not used to it when the truth is she's the reason why I'm not a depressed mess right now(I'm 18 and can't get a job and am out of school cause of anxiety) and I'm basically home everyday. She's the only thing that makes me feel good about myself. So yeah, basically I'm scared that one morning I'm gonna wake up seeing that she killed herself. Just the thought of that makes me wanna cry for days. She won't get help which I stress for her to do, and she doesn't seem to think it's gonna get any better. Basically what I'm asking is to what I should do in this situation? My dad knows about her plan because he's the main one I talk too, and I just really really don't wanna lose her because I feel like I wouldn't be able to deal with anything.

What really gets me down now is a rather common thing in life, being kind of reminded how much you like a friend when they tell you they won't me around tomorrow since then gonna have a date with that guy.

I'm so aware the being friends with someone you have feelings for is a terrible idea, and an even worse one to rely on that person in so many ways, especially concerning My mental state. 

So I want her to have fun and be happy yet at the same time shake her and tell her how cruel It is, not to do certain things but to do them right in my face. I know that's really immature to blame her for that but I just hate how my whole mental condition sucks Now And realising how much it depended on someone it shouldn't depend on.

Maybe it's that I am on different meds, whatever the opposite gender is cruel. Very.

If your therapist is telling you to see someone else, I would expect them to tell you why, and what they anticipate happening. Talking to a psychologist seems strange, if you already have a therapist. It would make sense to see a psychiatrist in addition to a therapist, so that you can investigate medication options. If you've been depressed for a decade, it sounds like you could have dysthymia, and therapy can help you learn to cope with relationships and life, but low-level depression may be with you forever unless treated. Trust me, you want to treat it, you won't believe what life is like for normal people. It's like finding out everyone has partying in the champagne room while you were out looking for a parking space your whole life.

&gt; I think about suicide frequently. Most people do I think.

Nope. i was as surprised as you to find that out. I just assumed everyone thought that way. Therapists, psychiatrists and partners have all expressed surprise when I tell them I think about suicide, despite them being well aware I suffer from depression. To me, the two are almost synonyms, but you have to realize to normal people depression just means being really sad, or feeling bad. if you don't say ""I'm suicidal"", or ""I think about killing myself every few hours"", nobody will expect that to be the case. I felt terrible when I accidentally told my (ex) girlfriend I was taking lithium because it reduces suicidal thoughts and she kinda did a double take and asked ""do you think about suicide?"". Honey, I've been unable to get out of bed for two months, and I cry every night, I didn't think this was a surprise! :D

&gt; She wants me to see a psychologist though. Not sure why. I am worried she thinks something is wrong with me. A mood disorder or something.

She's right. Do you think you *don't* have something wrong? You said you've had depression for ten years, doesn't that qualify as a mood disorder? It sounds like you may be having trouble recognizing what is wrong and that it really is a problem and that it really is treatable. The good news is that it sounds like you've got several people on your side who care about you, pushing you to get help.

&gt; I didn't tell her too much about my suicidal thoughts as I was worried she would want to commit me.

You'll only be committed against your will if you're an imminent danger to yourself or others. Are you going to kill yourself tonight? Are you going to kill someone else tonight? You need to be honest with your therapist and other professionals about your thoughts, and let them know how serious they are, so they can help you figure out the best way to deal with it all. Think about your own patients -- you need them to be honest about drugs they are taking, or if something hurts, so that you can treat them properly. It's no different for helping someone with depression.

I can understand if you don't want to reveal so much to your mom. That's a tough conversation and can bring out all sorts of feelings of guilt, shame, pride, love, remorse, regret. You deserve to let her know the truth, but it's OK to start slowly. Let her know that yes, you are suffering from depression and may need her help to get better. Let her know more over time, as you're both comfortable with it. One of the things a therapist can help you with is getting ready for those kinds of conversations with family.

They repeat in my head non-stop. A statement that has been too consistent for comfort. It is not a literal call to action. More so, It is a cry for help. For years I've been trying to get this sentence that rots my brain out of my head, but the words repeat like a skipping record. I have no idea who to tell these words to or why I would even do so. What would it even accomplish? What the hell do I even expect? I could let all my friends and family in an instant, but I know it would only met with rolled eyes and some messages on a screen trying to help just for a day or two. 

With that said, ""I want to kill myself."" Not all of myself. Just the part that won't let the petty arguments and insults die. The part that tells me I'm never good enough. The part that makes me second guess every damn relationship I have formed with a human being. The part that's a jealous piece of shit because other people got there shit together while I just keep shitting myself having no idea what to do with it. 

Okay my life isn't as bad as whatever the hell I just described. The point is that it's all in my head. I need to be preoccupied with something. I'm trying to find a way to make my art degree relevant, but I just get really caught up in how things didn't work out. I have to accept semi-defeat because I really want to make it work. Now is just not the time. I may have to go back to school for something I will decide later.

43759,,True,fap_armstrong,,,,"&gt; What did you like about this girl? Why was she so special?

The main thing that attracted me about her was her intelligence. When I first met her she was just getting started learning programming and it has been fascinating to see how quickly she picked up very complex concepts. Even as a veteran programmer she could always provide a new perspective that made me think. She is also very creative, drawing, sewing and building things, I admire that. There was also a physical connection, she is basically the definition of my type. These things and more allowed me to ignore the lack of emotional connection due to her lack of interest in me. I'm sure the fact that she is a woman and she actually talked to me was playing a role too, with so little interaction with women something as simple as hanging became extra special.

&gt; What kind of guy are you? You sound pretty cool to me. Do you have any hobbies, things you like doing?

I would call myself an introvert, I'm pretty shy around people I don't know but I work pretty well in small to medium groups of people as long as we are in an environment where the sound levels allow conversation. I think many times I am too concerned with helping others that I forget to think about what I want so I can come off as a pushover. My great passion is programming but admittedly since I started working full time with it I don't spend as much time coding in my spare time. I also enjoy exercise, my favorites are yoga and running but I also enjoy weight lifting. Exercise is definitely something that helps me avoid going to deep into the depression but motivation gets tricky on the bad days.

Thank you for your comment, just writing about this stuff is helping me process the thoughts and emotions. It seems to help me stop mulling them over again and again, I should probably start journaling for my own sake, just to clear my mind of useless repeating thoughts.",,0.0,,2013-08-08 07:47:01,,,0,False,,,,0,,cbjcyb6,,,,,t3_1jvz7i,,,t1_cbjcyb6,,,,t1_cbj271b,,,,,,,,1429904645.0,,1,False,,,,,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,1,,

We're both students at university,  her just having finished and me in my 2nd year we're both 22). She showed signs of anxiety before she found out she was pregnant, things such as wanting to leave the cinema early when watching a film or getting of the train a stop early. Apparently this was triggered by some sort of choking episode she had faced on a train previously. Things started to get really bad just after we found out she was pregnant. We were a  little shocked about the pregnancy at first but it soon turned to nervous excitement.  I thought it was a mere hormonal thing and first and that  this is what pregnant people are like,  but having researched it online, only a small number of women suffer from anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Now 14 weeks into her pregnancy, things are slowly getting worse. She can't leave the house and when we go for short walks outside she gets herself into a blind panic. She is constantly terrified of being on her own and has to have either me or somebody else close to her with her at all times in the house with her. She just seems absolutely drained of any sign of content unless she's super tired or asleep. As a result of her illness,  she is unable to work and finds it a tremendous challenge to get to therapy. She is currently on a low dose of Setraline which her doctor has approved as safe and she has been taking it for about a week. I've had to miss work to stay and look after her and this is our only real source of income during summer when we get no financial aid from university. She used to be the independent one within our relationship and it's like everything has flipped around and I'm struggling to help her despite my effort.

I've been to the doctor and seen a psychologist for a while but then stopped at the start of this year. It helped me a little through some of the worser times, but I don't think it would help much more now, or at least I feel I've gotten as much as I can from that specific psychologist. I might try a different psychologist some time. I don't know, it's an option.

I haven't tried any medications and I don't really want to try them at the moment, specifically SSRI's due to their possible side effects and difficulty getting off them once your on, as I've read.

I have read into [SAMe](http://examine.com/supplements/S-Adenosyl+Methionine/) which has been shown to have some anti-depressant effects with fewer side-effects, although the onset is slow. I might try that some time. 

Not sure about the anxiety though. How do you generally use the Xanax, do you take it before situations that you know you will be anxious in, as a preventative? Is it much help taking it after anxious events? I don't know if it help me with the constant base-line level of anxiety that I feel nearly constantly, I don't really get panic attacks or specific high anxiety points, except maybe when having to make phone calls, and some social situations, maybe it could help with that.

Have you tried other therapy in the past? How was this one different in helping you more? It sounds great having such an improvement from just one session.

If you're falling off the radar off of everything, you may have depression.  I isolate myself like a sensory deprivation chamber, and I know it is bad for me but I still withdraw when I'm not feeling too hot.  

I'm sorry for all the difficulties you probably go through as a minority group in a country where most people have only binary attitudes towards everything.  You are lucky that your wife stayed, and if she stayed, I hope it is because of the purest love she has for you.

I think you may be unhappy because you don't see this happening as a choice, and I will admit, not being like everyone else hurts in a way (though it is funny that all those people who look the same wish they were different--kinda telling about human nature).  

Why is the transition too late, if you don't mind me asking?  Is carrying a child important to you?  Is it possible with surgery for you.  Would it be a bad idea for your wife to carry your child?  

I'm sorry that you have been driven to such desperation.  Gender identity is such a core of our being that we suffer if there is a mismatch.

You know what to generally expect if you stay in St. Louis. And yeah you might not want a career with the job you take, but you just graduated college, gaining work-experience is probably a good idea, but gaining life-experience is even better. It's easier to migrate to what you want to do with career experience and, in my opinion, a more worldly experience will help you. Don't worry about the guy, because if you build up your expectations of him being the key to happiness/stability in the city and things fall flat then you will be even more lost than you are now.

It won't be easy at first, but I say do it. If it really doesn't work out you can always move back. But a lot of it is about attitude.

80817,,False,blake057,,,,"Thanks. Just being able to tell someone really helps. I am over 18, however, I'm not getting that money back. I grew up poor (we still are) and I know my money was used to pay bills and necessities. I'm upset with her for it, but I also can't bear for her to know our financial situation affected so much. 

There is no one else I can live with. My situation isn't anywhere near terrible, just uncomfortable. I'm fed, not abused, etc., so I'll try and make the most of what I have. 

And I loved Paris so much. It was all I wanted and more since I'm a history major who focused on the French Revolution. My professors were amazing and it was perfect. 

On a side note, when I was a child I always wished something tragic would happen to me so I could overcome it and be a great success story. I imagined my life being made into a movie and hitting my lowest part. Be careful what you wish for, eh? So I'm pretending this is my big setback that I can reflect upon later and be proud I overcame it.

12853,,True,Kardlonoc,,,,"&gt;The problem is that first i hate my personality, and second i really can't.

I think you should accept who are first. You should accept and love your personality. There is nothing wrong with it. 

I say this because you can't force change. If you try to be something your are not you just feel alienated and bad. Changes if you want to make them must be gradual, you need experience in doing things different.

Try not to internalize either. 

&gt;I do not do any illegal drugs, but i use legal drugs them in an addictive manner; I am addicted to caffeine. I take, though don't abuse, 50mg of zoloft which doesn't really do much.

So half the world. To be honest there is nothing wrong with addiction unless it really bugs you. People paint and ugly picture for addiction yet still drink coffee every morning. But if it troubles you to stop you either need to burn out your addiction or drop it cold turkey or some combination of both. 

&gt;I am to nervousness to ask for help because for some stupid reason i have an ego which i am protecting or something.

Don't think about it just ask. Try stop thinking about ego and id as well you are using them as excuses to not do things. 

&gt;I have apathy towards all the wrong things. I do not care about disagreeing withs someone and arguing against them. I don't care about the people who got stuck in the cave in Chili or the victims in Darfore. I don't care about other peoples suffering. I do care about other peoples judgement of me. I am a selfish and i hate it but it is what i am like now. 

Honestly there is nothing wrong with thinking this way its in fact normal.. Remember how I said life is eternal suffering?  You see no matter what you do there will always be some poor saps somewhere suffering from something and because of it its completely natural not to care. You and your problems are more important than the problems of the world that's how it is. There is nothing wrong with being selfish and stop thinking that there is.  Getting what YOU want is always selfish even what you want is to help people out in darfur or something. 

See capitalist society runs on people selfish and greed for the good of all. There is no altruism because whatever you do will eventually benefit you in some way. 

&gt;The thing that i hate most about myself is that I am completely dominated by demon and feel that i can't to disregard what he is saying. I am controlled by addiction and that demon voice i have very little freewill of my own.

It does sound more and more like a mental problem. But I what you to know that all of this is up in your head. They are illusions and thoughts that arent real. Becoming a willful person that can override these things takes practice but can be accomplished. Set small goals for your self everyday that turn into big ones so you can simply ignore anxiety and fear. Do things that are uncomfortable to you until they become comfortable.
