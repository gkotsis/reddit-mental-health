I've talked to her younger brother, but he's 18 and isn't really equipped to handle things. The rest of her family are VERY traditional oldschool Asian who denied that she was even depressed for years. Her parents still won't even admit there is a real problem; they think her previous suicide attempt was a ploy for attention. Her ex has done more harm than good. He saw the cuts and went off on her, calling her a crazy bitch. Not very good support.     

Right now I'm mostly trying to get her to go to her psychiatrist. I dont know him, but I'm trying to find out who she has been going to. She goes back and forth on that,  mostly saying that she is ""ok"" and I ""shouldn't worry"" so she doesn't need him right now. She knows I'm worried, and she knows I'm only concerned for her safety.


I'm going to try today to look up more support in her area, and trying to plan a trip down to see her.  I'm working on our mutual friends, but a lot of things have gone down that I wasn't aware of and most of them are pretty alienated from her right now.

I don't feel like I actually want to, but I can't stop my mind from thinking about it, and imagining it. I keep crying for no reason, getting really angry and having outbursts where I don't even feel like I am in my own body, and overwhelming anxiety that like the anger outbursts, make me feel out of my body and dizzy. 

I feel like I am a failure in everything I do in life, and I doing nothing but failing every day. I have trouble waking up in the mornings and sleep in badly. Alarms just put me in a foul mood for the day. I go into university where I am studying for my doctorate, but my research is going badly and it makes me feel like a failure. I also have no motivation to do work anymore. Sort of like, why try doing anything new, it won't work anyway, just like all the other ideas I have had. Then I go to the gym after the day to do weights, which I also feel like a failure at because I haven't been making strength or size gains for months. When I get home, I cook dinner for my diet I started a month ago, and do some cardio to cut fat, but that is a failure too because I can't seem to lose much. Then, I go to sleep and do it all over again. I feel like I am in a vicious cycle of failure and I can't see a way out of it.

I have seen a psychologist previously for anxiety issues (social and general). She was concerned that I may have depression last time I saw her because of my constant fatigue and lack of motivation to do anything. I think I may need to go back and see her, but I can't even motivate myself to go to the doctor and be referred back to her. It just seems so much easier to sit around and wallow, I am scared to admit to anyone the problems that I am having. I am scared people will think I am pathetic and immature and over-reacting. But I can't help how I feel.

While I haven't yet found any really compelling logical reasons why my life should continue, I haven't yet ruled out the possibility that clinical depression is skewing my perspective, and I'd like to ask about how I might specifically tackle that possibility.    

I have a deep distrust of health care professionals, however, having been badly ripped off by doctors recently. Worse, my dwindling savings are the lifeline that is allowing me to delay dealing with the larger question, so I can ill-afford to misfire on my attempt to seek professional help.

I used to be a cutter, but I've never attempted suicide. 

Found myself pregnant about seven years ago, with my long-term boyfriend. Had a kid, thought I had a reason to keep on living this dreary drudge of a life. Then he and I split, he got custody (better support network from family) and I get visitation. Still, our daughter was my reason for going to work at a thankless job and putting a smile on my face. 

Well, now my ex has a new girlfriend who loves my daughter, and my daughter loves her. The girlfriend is a nanny and is great with kids, while I simply care for my child because she's mine and I refuse to be the kind of mother that I had, not because I love kids. 

Seeing the two of them interact makes me feel like I'm totally replaceable and nobody would really give two hoots if I went away and never came back.

I've been living with my dad for two years, going to school full time. Prior to this I was working, out on my own, paying all of my bills, doing my own thing. Stepmother kicked my father out, my dad became a miserable drunk and I ended up moving in with him, dropping my job and going to school full time while basically fucking babysitting him.


A few weeks ago my stepmother calls my father up to ""talk about things"". Next thing I know they both want me out so they can move in together. This caught me way off guard. I dropped all my classes and started frantically searching for any sort job I could get. It's only been 8 days now. Talking to managers, applications, networking, everything I can to find any sort of work. Nothing has come up yet.

Not good enough. I should have landed something by now, according to them. 8 days. Is it just me or is this completely fucking irrational?
Stepmother has already begun fighting with my dad about all of this (and other things), and it looks like it's not going to work out between them (again) and I feel like it's my fault. I want the best for my dad. I want him to grow old with someone he loves. I feel like a burden. I've thought about suicide and sometimes I think he'd be a lot happier with me gone.

You will be a strong and determined lady once you realize the perception of yours can be altered just by yourself. I and we as the community of this subreddit can only hold a candle for you but you are the sun of your own world.





I am sure you will be adding values to people in future, big or small but you will. Keep up the hard work.





Another advise is pay attention science, check how the earth became and the humanity you will see its all numbers and that the life is very simple, but we make it complex. So, simplfy your own world, be happy just to wake up with all your senses. Washing your face is not a mundane job, appericiate it, do it with ecstasy. Even know there are millions of people(million is a big number) do not have drinking water yet we take shower easily, have electricty and internet(knowledge accessible)




I know my message is complicated but keep reading, you will see the grand meaning once you follow my humble advises.






EDIT: About your sister, its a known fact that they get more attention. Its not your fault or your sisters, your parents should be equal. I am sorry to state that your parents are not ideal like most of our parents arent. You should not hate your sister, I know maybe you cant control it.

I'm a 27-year-old female.  I know that in the grand scheme I'm rather young, but I feel like I've made a ton of mistakes in my life up to this point.

When I was in school, I didn't have many friends.  I participated in sports and clubs, but I didn't go out much and was mostly a loner.  In college I broke out of my shell a bit and made some good friends and ended up having sex a couple times, but I never had an actual relationship.   As soon as I graduated, I moved back to my hometown and have been more or less suffering ever since.

A lot of people tell me that I don't have ""real"" problems; my immediate family is all alive and doing well for themselves.  I have a job and I have decent health.  But I have no real connections with people.  I don't know how.  I go out sometimes, but I don't make friendships with people despite being talkative and social.  I live alone and I spend most of my nights alone.  I buy nice things for my apartment even though no one ever comes over (so coming home ends up a reminder of how lonely I am).  I don't have people I feel comfortable to just call up who would go out and do things with me.  I haven't had sex since college.  I haven't dated since college.  At work I am constantly being talked to about coming across as negative or not smiling enough and am on the verge of being fired despite getting my work done well and on time, and I've worked at this job for three years (only in the last year did it start going downhill like this).  Whenever I fix a problem, they tell me I'm doing something else wrong.  This job pays exceptionally well and has benefits that I need, so quitting isn't an option unless I find something good to replace it, which I haven't yet (I recently interviewed at a nice place but was denied the position).

Basically - I'm tired of feeling abnormal. I'm tired of being alone all the time. And most of all I'm tired of having so many people tell me what I'm doing wrong.  I don't want to be like this forever, but considering I've been like this most of my life (with the exception of some parts of college) I don't forsee much changing.  I'm broken, and the only reason I don't just off myself is because it would make my parents upset.  It's harder and harder to interact with people because I have to fake happiness and lie about what I spend my time doing (""Oh I was home alone last night!"").  

I just want to feel like I'm doing things the right way. I want to feel wanted by other people.  I want to feel like I'm living my life well.  I'm tired of getting shit on by work and my social life and my lack of relationship (when I'm almost 30 years old).

I had a panic attack, which is so freaking understandable looking at my history (if you want an overview, look at my first SW post). I couldn't handle it... my wellbeing was not looked out for. An ambulance was not called. And I am being blamed.

I actually joined a fraternity that year and gave up on my degree after 2 months of participating. So it's not really fair to say that I didn't enjoy my degree, because the fraternity was devouring all the free time I had as a first year. 

However, it gave me some time to think about what I wanted to do. I went to several facilities within my University, just to get informed about the different programs I could enroll in. Sadly, I ended up quitting the next program too, because of some family issues I had to deal with.

Yes, it can be embarrassing to fail your classes, but it has a reason. You flat out dislike what you're doing. That would send anyone over the edge at some point.

My advice? Figure out what you want. Just go the Uni and visit several different departments. Just go there and talk to the brass about the educational programs they offer. You might like what you find!

When you get your shit together, you might have a shot at your girlfriend too. It sounds to me she just left because she wasn't able to deal with your issues.

Now, a year later, still unemployed, having been rejected from 8 EMT positions even though I graduated top of my class, I'm stuck reminiscing over this anniversary. 

I seem stuck in this rut of not wanting to do anything or go anywhere. I skip class constantly because I can't muster the strength to pull my pants up. I can't stand the fact that I left a depressing life at a desk to get paid to live a depressing life at a desk to get paid.

If I make under a 2.0 this semester, my GI Bill benefits will be suspended and I won't have any source of income.

I can't seem to find a job anywhere, and I'm not going to be able to live off of $500 a month in disability. What in the hell can I do?

I've figured out that I become significantly less depressed when I'm around people.  It's something that helped me out in college, and I think it can work again.

I don't think that drugs will help me in the long run.  No, what I need is to be reminded that people don't entirely suck.  Therefore, I think I'm going to start my survey of Christianity that I've talked about on that subreddit.  It's something I've been genuinely curious about for some time now, and it's time I actually started.  Of course, it's not a mission I can complete on my own, and I intend to set up a web-based system to help collect information from other groups from other corners of the world (I'm a programmer after all, and if I can't do that, then I'm really sunk).

The choice of religion is not one that's popular with Reddit, I know.  However, I've come to the realizaton that as long as I live by pure reason and logic, as I've tried to do over the last few years, I'm not going to be okay.  I need something beyond that.  It's a personal thing, admittedly, and I'm not going to suggest that religion is for everyone.  Just know that like everything, I'm doing this on my own terms, and not because someone told me to believe in something.

Furthermore, I'm going to start reaching out to old, forgotten friends.  I've got a lot of people on Facebook that I've not talked to in years.  Perhaps I should rectify that.  It's not like I can't get out at all anymore.  The wall I've built must come down, and it must do so in a manner that doesn't destroy me, too.

I told them my marks came in today (they've actually been in a while, and I've known it's bad news since I walked out of the last exam having done the shittest essay imaginable), so today is my limit. I've finally manage to lie myself into the corner. 

If I admit I fucked up and try to explain it as depression and anxiety (which it is), they'll just say I'm making up excuses. I sort of agree. I could have done something, but I sat there doing nothing. Whatever was going on in my brain, at the end of the day I chose not to do that coursework and I chose to sit there reading reddit instead of a textbook.

I literally can't ignore it any more, and I don't know what to do. That's the worst thing, and I can't handle having no idea. Up to now, I've at the very least known what I'll be doing the next day. Now, the phone has rung twice in an hour and it's not going to stop. I don't know what I'm going to do this evening, let alone tomorrow, next week or for the next 60 years. I've got no hobbies, no friends, nothing to hang on to. Until now, I was just able to sit there doing very little, and that filled up a day. It was a thing I did, but it just took time. It's not something I chose to do, I don't really want to be the person sitting there doing literally nothing. I can't even say I can beat a lot of computer games or something. It's certainly not something I really plan. It was the plan, but I can't say ""at least I've still got /r/askreddit to read"" and it's not like a club I can still attend through all this mess. This is the furthest into not knowing I've ever been. I can't do anything except worry about that. The only way I'd get any certainty is killing myself. That's it. It solves the problem of me being a worthless waste of oxygen, solves the problem of clearing up my mess and solves the problem of me having to live this shit life.

I don't know exactly what I did wrong (well, I did everything wrong, but I don't know why), but there's something wrong and there's no way to fix it. I don't want to live this life, and I'm not going to get any other. One last moment of certainty, a guarantee of what's happening next (nothing). It'd be sweet.

152972,,True,mtftranstemp,,,,"Meds may work well for some people, but all the research I've been reading suggests that it's largely an enhanced placebo response and not clinically significant (see http://joannamoncrieff.com/2014/07/02/continuing-the-antidepressant-debate-the-clinical-relevance-of-drug-placebo-differences/ -- Joanna Moncrieff is a psychiatrist and researcher / academic). Antidepressants 'work' in the sense that they're no different to other psychoactive drugs (see http://joannamoncrieff.com/2013/11/27/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-antidepressant/).  They may improve rating scale scores slightly based on improved sleep, etc but without doing much for underlying mood. They also don't seem very targeted either, not faring any better than other classes of drugs it seems.

I've had plenty of experience with psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD, and found them to be quite insightful, but not very useful for treating depression, personally.  They're too unpredictable at this stage, and research is rather preliminary.  Until more research is done and treatment is standardised and legalised, I'd be staying well away from them. I definitely wouldn't be condoning their use for depressed people.  I'm also not really sure I'd be touching benzos given their addictive potential, not to mention psychiatrists seem quite reluctant in prescribing them.  The psychiatrists I've seen have both spouted the 'chemical imbalance' nonsense to me, which has contributed to me losing their trust.  Also, who's to say my increased risk of suicide hasn't been the result of the different drugs I've been trialled on? I also believe psychiatrists are very dismissive with this thorny question, preferring to blame it instead on the underlying 'disease'.

I'm not sure where that article is confusing causation and correlation, but I didn't mean to select it for its scientific viewpoint, but more its humanistic and psychosocial approach it advocates over the current system. It seemed relevant to what OP was discussing. I'm sure I can dig up plenty of research on treatment outcomes if that's what you're after.

David Healy's work is very good at highlighting the adverse effects of medications and how these and other outcomes are buried in clinical trials, distorted or completely excluded. Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3YB59EKMKw left me completely disillusioned about psychiatric meds and in particular the clinical trial process.  As he points out, the issue seems to be with a lot of evidence-based medicine, but is particularly prevalent in psychiatry.

Or, if you're interested in the iatrogenic effects of medications, check out this talk by Robert Whitaker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R6MXO2j0V0

If you're still interested and have the time, this talk by Joanna Moncrieff is also good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV1S5zw096U

All of these these authors seem to have some great publications and books: Joanna Moncrieff, David Healy, Robert Whitaker, Irving Kirsch, Peter Breggin, Daniel Carlat, Ben Goldacre.  It's not just my own experiences that have made me effectively write-off medications, although this has contributed (also see the STAR*D trial), but also my own research which hasn't exactly left me very optimistic about meds..

Maybe there IS something out there that can help, but the current disease-centred approach of treating depression leaves a lot to be desired.  At the moment it seems psychiatrists treat clusters of symptoms by playing pill roulette.  There certainly seems to be little rhyme or reason to the prescribing process - how can there be when the underlying mechanisms of depression aren't understood? I like Joanna Moncrieff's drug centred approach (see http://joannamoncrieff.com/2013/11/21/models-of-drug-action/) and would rather be prescribed medications in this manner -- recognising that meds don't actually 'fix' an underlying issue but dampen certain emotions, affect behaviours, etc.  The problem is, psychiatrists don't seem to classify or prescribe drugs in this way unfortunately.

Given the above, I'm more interested in therapy but I haven't had any luck in that area either.  I've seen psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors for therapy which hasn't really helped at all.  It's nice to talk to someone, but I never really found it useful. I've also looked at mindfulness, CBT, etc and just can't see how they could possibly help.  If someone is depressed because of their situation which is unlikely to change, then how can therapy possibly change that? It just seems to me that we live in a severely broken society and rat race, and that focusing on the individual seems to be putting the horse before the cart.",,0.0,,2014-08-30 22:57:20,,,0,1409437063,,,,0,,ck4xuwg,,,,,t3_2exp2d,,,t1_ck4xuwg,,,,t1_ck4s0fq,,,,,,,,1427278259.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

I've tried all kinds of medication and have been to numerous different professionals without any success. Now the latest few years, since my graduation, things have been slowly getting worse. I developed social anxiety 2 years before graduation, making me lose quite a few friends. I have since gotten better on that front. I now have 2 friends whom I spend time with (got a few other people too, but aren't really my friends, more like my girlfriends friends) but I can rarely hang out with them. They are roommates and usually hang out with a girl they got pretty good friends with and since they only have 1 extra place to sleep, I can't go there when she's there - which is like all the time. I've been there to hang out once in a month and a half. All other time is spent in front of my computer, playing videogames and having the occasional visit from my girlfriend who mostly hang out with her friends where I more often than not isn't included. I've tried reaching out to people to try and be friends again but they either doesn't answer or they make plans with me only to cancel on me in the last second every single time. 



I tried pick up a hobby, which I did, but that doesn't feel fullfilling anymore. I remember the joy I felt when finishing a song and uploading it, but that spark just isn't there anymore. I rarely have the inspiration to make anything and just end up being frustrated. When I do get a song done I never find any female singer to work on it with me. I make melodic electronic music and want female singing to it. I have 4 songs just collecting dust right now. 2 of them was sent to a singer a year ago and now she has stopped replying when I write and the other 2 was sent to a different singer who said that she'll try make something of it but that was 5 months ago now so I don't see that happening.


I've been applying for jobs like a maniac for the last 3 years and have went to a total of 2 interviews where they didn't even let me know that I wasn't selected or even bothered answering or returning my calls. I'm so FUCKING lonely it's driving me insane.

Sharing your feelings and thoughts will allow you to find a way to overcome what you're feeling and hopefully find new outlets. You can do this. She can do this...you can fight together. But just know that you have support here...what city/state do you live in? Hopefully reddit can help you find housing, or someone may be able to take you in. But just know that you will get through this. You will be okay. You are a human being, and thus strong, beautiful, and capable of anything -- even at the lowest points. Please keep in touch with us and let us know your whereabouts, feel free to PM me or anyone else. Hang in there, and please, please don't kill yourself. You are a human being, and thus...you are worth it in this world.

Just a few moments ago I felt completely numb from my whole body and state of mind, as if I was physically dying or like my body was not real. I started focusing on something important to me and and now (2 minutes later) I feel ""normal"" again.

I'm having upsetting thoughts today.

I know I should be leaving my house again today to look for work but I can't get myself out of my room. I had a hot shower and was planning on getting ready to leave but ended up in my bed without any thought in my head and tried to sleep because I needed the comfort.

I feel like my mind is trying to detach from my reality and from my body as of current.

I want to call my doctor to make an appointment to look into Beta Blockers but I don't know what is wrong with me right now, because usually I am fine.

I feel like nothing what I am doing right now makes any sense.

It is only a matter of time. I'm barely living on the fact that my fav band is going to do a tour and release new album, but otherwise, my life is a joke.

I've been on 5 different antipsychotics, an antidepressant, and anxiolytics. On 3 right antipsychotics now alongside with diazepam. My mind haunts me, I'm confused, I'm getting bad marks, barely do fitness anymore, pdoc says I can't even fucking bicycle under these meds. I've fallen in love(hopelessb, and worst of it is that I've basically no social skills. They suspect of asperger and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, mixed anxiety and depression and OCD( the last two may no longer be relevant) So far I've seen 5 psychiatrist and either they were bad or they only worked in hospital. Might come back to my old psychiatrist, he's far away but hey.

In therapy for 3 years, with different therapists. I feel like no one understands.

My life is a fucking joke. I'm barely living day to day and question if I'm on a right path 3 times a day. Yoga helps me a bit, I hardly meditate anymore. Everything just seems meaningless. All of it. I do not respond to medication, at least until now, in every social interaction I need to think about everything, and not being in touch with reality doesn't help. Does she like me? Is it my delusion?

I'm just a shell in a sea. I feel worthless. Again, I'm laughing. I just want to swallow my last dose of meds.

I can barely think with this medication and finals are approaching, so do the test for unis. I just can't live like this. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. I just want to go.

Sometimes it seems like I've a million personalities. In on minute I'm like that in another...

I'm just so confused. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I fall in love with all the wrong people. I just want to die.

It's just too comfortable to be in a position that's neither (truly) living, nor (truly, and finally) dying.  It's just too comfortable watching everything else happen.

However, in a moment of weakness, or perhaps boredom, one might open oneself to obligations.  Only to regret it after a while and cut everyone off.  This repeats over and over and over again until perhaps one is tired, or people around stop giving a damn.  Would this be enough to push one over the edge? Maybe.  But it's also possible for one to just move elsewhere (in the internet or in real life) and start the cycle all over again.

It's kind of tiring, but it's way more comfortable than having to do anything to ensure that this ends.

Maybe this is the reason why some choose to look for a partner.  It's not just nore reassuring, it also forces you to go through with the plans, to get out of one's comfort zone and do something to end things once and for all.

I'm 20 now, and I've been pretty much ok for the past year, but things get bad when I'm stressed or when situations like this occur.

Yesterday was the final exam for one of my easy introductory college classes. I woke up late and had to rush to make it to class on time. I realized I forgot my wallet so I didn't have any ID, but this professor has never required ID for any test before so I figured it was ok. I only have a pencil and my cell phone with me. Well, it wasn't ok and she required ID for the final. I handed in my test and explained to her that I forgot my wallet and I'm very sorry but I don't have any ID. She was pissed and said ""why would you do, how stupid are you?"" and continued to yell at me saying ""you always need to show ID for finals, haven't you ever been to school before?"". This went on for 5 minutes with her yelling and sighing and saying there was nothing she could do, before she told me it was ok and let me hand in the test.

To make matters worse, I missed one of the tests for this class (do to an anxiety attack). The final grade takes into account only 3 of the 4 tests taken in the semester. I thought it would be ok if I only took 3 tests but now I'm not so sure. This was pretty stupid on my part, but if it's not ok and she counts the zero I'm pretty much screwed because I can't go to talk to her after yesterday.

I don't know how to deal with this. I've always been a top student, I have a 94 average in this class and a 3.8 GPA. I have never been yelled at like that before and it has me really shaken up. I don't understand why she was was freaking out so much or why she couldn't understand that I made a mistake.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,default,"Professor berated me in front of class, and it's possible I could fail, please help calm me down",2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hecun/professor_berated_me_in_front_of_class_and_its/,

I neen unhappy for nearly eight years. First, I accepted a killer job I thought where I was getting paid a ton and working an odd schedule nights. I worked 3 nights on and 3 nights off and then 4 nights on and 4 nights off. 

Suddenly I became more depressed than ever. I couldnt sleep during the say to save my life. I would come home at 7am and sleep until 11. It was rough. Luckily there was a reorg and I was shifted back to normal business hours. I was also informed I could work from home. I was super excited

When I started working from home and alone all thise hours, I went nutso and felt isolated but it was better than the corporate world I was trying to get away from because I despised it. I despised long hours and the bullshit that goes with the perception of working 80 hours a week to be important. 

During this new found freedom of working at home I used the time to be involved in pure day fuckery. Fuck all evening and sick all day. What else was a 22-23 year old guy with a fat bank account, nice loft, and freedom going to do? 

Fuck it away of course. Well boys and girls I fucked the wrong chick. I knocked her up and things didn't go so well. From day one she claimed I was abusive behind my back because I was upset she cheated on me and lies. She ran away with our kid and left me high and dry. She came back into my life and its been a living nightmare besifes the only happiness I get is when I spend the few hours pf my miserable existence with our child. Now my bank account isnt so fat. She gets a big chunk of it, lives pff welfare and does pretty fucking good while having our child 80% of the time. 

Dating with a kid has been an utterly depressing situation. I have lived like a prison bitch to this woma who constantly manipulates and uses me all because she has something I love so much but can't do shit about it. I paid nearly 10k to an attorney and all it really did was make shit worse.

Ladies and gentleman. At nearly 31 years old. This is why I get sudden urges to blow my brains out.

The one I was closest to, Ian, was the most recent. I called him (we talked almost every day) as usual, the day before it happened. I asked how he was doing and he said he was fine. Hes  the type not to show that he's bothered, so I asked again; ""Really, how are you?"" He laughed and said ""M, I'm on top of the world right now. Really.""

29 hours later, I got a call from his oldest brother. Ian was in the hospital. Unresponsive. 30 minutes later, he called back and said Ian had passed and would be able to donate his organs as he had wished. I was in shock. A few days ago, his mother asked if I wanted to know how he had done it, as apparently people had asked. I burst into tears and told her no. I felt so selfish. I feel like if I knew what he did, I wouldn't forgive him. I'm so, so angry. And so distressed. I don't know what to do. Is this normal?

Your condition is causing you to be affected like this to the point that you don't think anything will work. It will, but you have to give it time.

You have a boyfriend that loves you, and trust in that as you have a very special connection with someone, and that's not to be taken lightly.

I suffer from PTSD and depression, and when I was at my worst I actually rationalized that if I killed myself that my parents would get over me as they deserved better. Guess what, that was totally wrong, and if I did do myself in, then it would affect everyone for generations!

You need to start to change your mindset here. You need to stop thinking negatively. I have some coping techniques that work for me, and I'm sure you've read about them, but give them a try: Every time that you start to feel a negative thought enter your mind try this - simply breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. This is a very, very ancient technique that will cause your mind to lose focus on the negative thought for a split second, and that will lessen the impact of the thought. - If you are like me, I tend to do self talk about whatever negative thought comes into my mind. What I've found that helps to stop them is by simply clenching my teeth. This stops me from vocalizing my thoughts, and that prevents the negative thought from affecting me as much. - This next technique is very effective, and that is you think of the funniest thing that you can remember, and every time a negative thought enters your mind you think of the funny thought instead. Stay away from the booze, or anything else that can alter your mood. Additionally, keep away negative movies, or comics...you need to watch comedy, and continually seek out anything that is humourous, and funny.

Start this now, and remember that you're not alone!:-)",,0.0,,2010-05-15 04:14:50,,,0,False,,,,0,,c0q1ob1,,,,,t3_c4alu,,,t1_c0q1ob1,,,,t1_c0q1n0p,,,,,,,,1426308004.0,,4,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,4,,

Yha, this is an idea I had with one other person.  Changing drugs and doctors, the system itself can seem pretty dehumanizing.  Having a sort of secretary might give you a way to at least have someone gauge your progress.

&gt; I've considered suicide since i was like, 13, but i hadn't really thought about it seriously until late 18/early 19, last spring.

Hints at genetic to me.  Clearly long-term issue.  I'll point out that ""suicidal emotions"" are not the same as decisions/actions/intentions.  It may help to think of it like sex urges.  Just because you want to have sex, doesn't mean you rush up and have sex with a woman.  You have to filter/manage/(and even)suppress the desire.  If you are lucky and work at it, you can almost think of it like a hunger pain or something that you choose to ignore.

It sounds like we have similar problems, in that both of us care for our family, but not the toxic relationship that they bring. I know that it is going to be hard to be separate from them if you move out, it was really hard on my dad when I did too. He really depended on me to get things done around the house and other things for him. If your family can't live together with out reason to call the police, for your sanity you need to get out of there. It will most likely hurt your parents if you move. It will most likely be hard to talk to them about it. But I would strongly suggest you do both. Its a shitty thing when you have to pick between your own sanity, and your family, but ultimately you have to pick what's best for you, regardless of how your parents or siblings feel. And hopefully, they will eventually get it, and you guys can maybe work on a relationship after wards. 

I know there were a bunch of maybe's and mostly's here, but that's only because I barely know anything about the situation, and everyone reacts differently to stuff. You can get through this though.

I used to like drawing, working on cars, playing soccer, and just generally being around people. I'm new to reddit so this might be in the wrong subreddit but hopefully not. About a year ago, I started noticing that certian things didn't really make me happy like they used to, then it escalated to nothing really makes me happy anymore, except for people but I'll explain that in a bit. I used to design tattoos, do custom drawings for people. I used to have a handful of friends, and I used to smile alot. Now, I can barely get out of bed unless someone makes plans for me. The only time I really feel anything anymore is when I'm flying down a road on my motorcycle, or in a car doing 100 plus, pushing cars and my little bike to their limits. And even then, I'm not afraid, scared, worried, or anything else, I just feel free. The only other time I feel anything close to happy is when someone shows interest in me, and usually when that someone is a guy. I know its stupid and probably some psycological symptom or another but the only other time I really feel happy is when some guy is interested in me. Which despite usually only lasting a short,and me doing most of the work having any conversation, it makes me feel kinda nice when I can pretend someone likes me, thinks that I'm pretty or mysterious, or even just wants to hit. Which is really sad to be cometely honest but oh well. I'm not sure how, or why, or when, but somehow I've systematically pushed away everyone that is/was close to me, while trying to cut negative people out of my life. You see, I've been online, and in librarys, read about how sometimes the reason a person is so down, is because the people around that person put them down. So I deleted people that never talk to me, or insult me alot, or that I was jealous of, or that tended to start drama. But then I realized, who's left? I don't have any real friends. I don't have anyone to message to talk to about anything, good or bad. I don't have anyone, period. My family is basically just using me as a supplementary source of income, and my mom thinks I should be admitted into a mental institution because I cut. She says  I'm a horrible influence on my brother because I'm depressed, even though I'm the one who spoils him, takes him to the mall, buys his videogames and slushies, got her to get him a phone since she never lets him see his friends, and practically raised him after his adhd and odd got pretty bad. She also thinks that I'm going to fail at whatever I try to do in my life because I don't want to go back to school full time and get a degree. I don't really want to kill myself, but I don't want to live feeling so empty and dissatisfied all the time. I wanna get better. I wanna feel happy and do things and meet people.

I'm mostly able to deal with it, but things are going to get tough in the next couple of days.

Before I get into that, the title of this post is referring to all the comments I've seen from people thinking they don't deserve to be alive for one reason or another. The following rant is not directed at any particular poster here, but: fuck that. No one has to earn the right to be alive. That's the most basic human right of all of them. You get it by being born and you don't lose it by angering people, or by being getting bad grades in school, or by getting treated like shit by other people, or by accidentally taking a shit on a bus, or any combination of the above. The resources that are being ""wasted"" keeping you alive are insignificant; suicide is not an environmentalist act nor is it going to help anyone around you. You know this. I know this. Why do I keep trying to die?

Truth is, I want to live. I don't want to commit suicide. I obviously don't want to be depressed. I'm also stuck trying to finish a project for work/school (as a grad student, it's all the same) that I started years ago and haven't made any progress at all on in over a year since the _last_ time I called a suicide hotline. I'd love to just quit, consequences be damned, but I can't bring myself to do it. I've literally told my supervisor that I wanted to quit (a year ago) but here I am, still in the same position. I feel it's almost impossible to fail out, but I can't finish either. The ""simple"" answer would be to just do the work, but I can't. I just can't. I feel like I can, but if I could I would probably have done it by now on one of the many nights when I genuinely felt like my life depended on it. I have a deadline coming up in a couple days. That's not unusual, I've missed more deadlines than it should even be possible to _have_. I'm not sure if I can go through it again though.

I still don't intend to commit suicide. Problem is, I don't really need to intend to do it at this point, since I've picked up enough self-harm habits that I'm worried I may not be able to stop myself from accidentally killing myself. This is _ridiculous_ but it is what it is. It would make sense for me to put myself on a real suicide watch of some sort instead of this subreddit, but I don't really have time for that. In fact, I should really get back to work.

So... not sure how to start, but I... dislike myself because of some of the things I've done earlier in my life. Now I try to treat everyone like I would like to be treated. I'm honest and I speak my mind when I feel it is necessary. This has given me a total of three really good friends during my lifetime, one which is my brother.

Guess I'll start with some back story, I will leave out a lot of less important thing.

I'm in my mid twenties by now and this started when I was about twelve and my mother kicked me out of the house. Lived with my grandmother for a few months, moved on to a foster family. Later I move to my father (parents divorced when I was 4) who lived in another city.

Drop out of school, get a job, move in with a friend while I work phone support. People screamed at me daily, didn't last more then a few months, no salary, friend kicks me out. Back at my fathers place again. Older sister is moving back to our old city, offers me a room in her apartment. Can't find a job, after 2 months she meets me downtown, demands the spare key, and suddenly I'm homeless.

Live in a friends trailer for a few weeks, move to another friend and sleep on his couch while I work illegally. When they don't need the extra help, I get no money so my friend kicks me out. I move to my brother, start living on welfare. Brother moves away, I take over the apartment.

Get in contact with a psychologist after a series of events. I don't tell him how I really feel, tell him I'm tired and I don't know what to do with life. Diagnosed with medium to severe depression, prescribed anti depressants and a weekly meeting with him.

Don't like the anti depressants, I become an empty shell with no emotions. I rather feel like shit 90% of the time, with 10% fun/ok, instead of a 100% ""less than ok"". The 10% is pretty much what keeps me going(tried three different anti depressants, same result, differing side effects).

So I quit taking anti depressants, and I also stopped seeing my psychologist.

---

This is pretty much where I'm at now, I had no plans on living long enough to be 18, because my actions would've escalated enough to put me in prison. Moving to my father got me away from shit that would've killed me.

People make me mad, humans can be so cruel and it upsets me greatly. A day doesn't pass that I think of some of the shit I've done and it used to make me vomit, but I've accepted the fact that I was a horrible person and I now do everything I can to be a good example for others.

My life is a waste, and I get paid in welfare for doing nothing. I hate myself for taking money that someone else needs more.

Every single morning, I think about my life, what I can do to improve the world, but I can't and I hate myself for not coming up with some grand plan on how to solve the shitty situation this world is in. I know it's stupid to blame myself for things I have no control over, but I still do.

The best solution I can come up with? Suicide. That's some genius thinking right there.

And all this before I leave bed in the morning. Every day, for almost 6 years now.

But I can't kill myself. I can't, because I don't want to hurt anyone, I value my family and my friends higher than me. I'm a waste in my eyes, but others don't think so, why else would they keep in contact with me? If someone I cared about committed suicide, without telling me about their thoughts and feelings, I would be so fucking mad. And yet, I haven't told any of my friends or family. I want to, but I don't want to make anyone's life harder, I don't want people going around thinking about how I feel all the time.

In some parts of the world, kids have to walk through minefields to get to school. Some people are risking their lives every day. And I? I sit in one of the top rated countries in the world, I have amazing chances to actually do something important and meaningful with my life, and I want to kill myself? I fucking hate myself, so much. I can't express it in words.

I spend my days browsing the internet, just to bombard myself with different things and information to keep my mind from thinking about myself, and when I do, I break down and cry.

I'm sorry if this doesn't really fit in here, I am not sure if I am close to suicide, because of the reasons stated above, but this shit is really getting to me these last couple of months.

I'm thinking about contacting my psychologist again, and start off by telling him everything.

I have since had many surgeries (30+) and have another coming up in two weeks on my birthday.  I was born with an imperforate anus and I can tell you a thing or two about being incontinent along with being in constant pain.  I had a cecostomy tube put in when I was 13 to flush my bowels daily and promote a some what ""normal"" life.  I had a huge infection and ended up in the hospital for over a year.  

Last fall I had extreme diverticulitis and had to have three more surgeries.  I ended up loosing what I had left of my rectum and most of my colon.  I now have a colostomy bag among other complications such as a MRSA infection that won't go away.  Honestly when I'm in severe pain I think about suicide constantly and other times just because I'm sick of the having to deal with this bull shit.  For some reason I can never go through with it since I have some insane instinct to survive.  I almost feel that all of the effort put into keeping me alive would have been wasted.  I will also say honestly I don't care if I wake up after each of my surgeries.  

You said ""don't waste my time telling me you understand"".  Well buddy it looks like you may have found one of the few people who might understand where you're coming from.

I'm so lonely in this world.

My husband wants a divorce.. 
We've been together for 9 years. Our relationship was perfect for the longest time. past few years have been rocky, and both of us didn't really try to make things better, as time went on we got further and further apart it seemed. 

about a month ago, i sat him down and explained how shitty our relationship has became, and that i thought it was time to separate. he understood, but he said that he didnt want it to end and that he would do everything in his power to fix our relationship. So we both desided to work things out and make things be how they used to be.

well, 2 weeks ago he told me he was done. he wanted a divorce and nothing i say can fix it.

Please. someone... that man is the love of my life. we're been together since we were in high school. I know things have been shitty lately, but fuck, i cant live without him. he means the world to me. Ive been crying for 2 weeks straight now. I can't handle this. Its the second worst pain i have ever felt in my life. I look at pictures of us, and remember memories we have, and look at the ring on my finger and remember what it means... how on earth could someone throw that away? how... i pour my heart and soul out to him every few nights telling him how much i need and want him to stay.. and he says nothing in return.. 

I dont know how to keep living..

Honestly, I have been where he is so I can tell you this much: even though he is saying he doesn't care and doesn't want to try, you are still the greatest help in the world to him. 

Don't get me wrong, his feelings are true to him, and they are devastating, but the fact that there was somebody, even if it was just one person (which is not true, I know that now) that cared for me, it stuck in the back of my mind the entire time. It meant tons.

Further, you can not let it do this to you. You need to seek help to make yourself better. As sad and cold as it may seem, *you* come first. You can't let it stress you out. It's completely unfair to put that much pressure on you when you're the only connection he has to living.

Maybe if you go to a counselor yourself, you can bring him in with you and you can both talk to him/her and it might help him a lot more than going alone. I saw a therapist weekly for over a year and it never did shit until I brought someone else in with me. It might give him the tiny sliver of motivation he needs to consider taking medication. I know a lot of people who took medication for depression, and once they were able to dig themselves out of the hell they were living with inside their mind, they didn't need the medication anymore and are going on years depression-free.

Either way, I really, really wish you the best. It's hard to see stuff like this when I've been there before. Trust me, it WILL get better. You can do it, and bring him along with you. Just know that if anything happens and he decides to do whatever he decides to do, you were NOT responsible. You're a great friend.

Here I am, finally. I don't really know how to go with this..

So yeah. I'm in a first world country, within a good family with a not too bad economical situation, no health nor abuse problems, a girlfriend of more than four years, university student with passable grades, so yeah, I'm afraid I'm going to sound like a whiner without anything real to complain about.

But yeah, it has been going on for a while, but I don't really have any motivation. Studies don't motivate me, I go to class only to spend my time doing other things, I play games or read books instead of doing proper homework and pass only through a mix of good instant memorization, asking friends and colleagues, last minute cramming, and sheer luck.
I cannot explain this supreme dislike of working. I might have had too easy a school life in the beginning since I didn't have to work to have good grades, but that has stop being the case already 4-5 years ago.
I have been having random thoughts of suicide since a long time back, with the middle school (or whatever you call it when you are 13) bullying, and then when my grades went down in high school.

I really find it hard to work. It takes me a long time to force myself to start doing something, and then I will go back to doing something else every five minutes most of the time. In class it's the same, I don't have enough interest to continue going on for more than five minutes. Nothing really interests me...

I have a few hobbies, reading fantasy, mangas, sci-fi, light novels or playing some games. Dungeons and Dragons is a hobby I particularly like, but yeah. All this is but a temporary setting my mind to something else than my life or than working, which isn't particularly helpful.

I have a pretty girlfriend, and quite nice, intelligent and funny too... But even so, my heart doesn't burn with anything strong enough to make me want to work for it. So yeah, I don't know, why the hell should I continue this pretend life of working towards a typical scheme when I die inside each time I find myself not working.
I feel apathetic, and I can only pretend to everyone I'm doing fine. I have tried talking already, to family friends psychologists and all, but except burdening more people, it hasn't seemed to change anything, so I pretended I was better.

The only reasons I still am going on are that I do not want to hurt the people I hold dear, and probably also that I am too cowardly (or I have too high a self-preservation, whatever) to actually try.

just sit down and it would just be something I would start thinking about, everytime you get a ""good"" idea (it's almost impossible to call them that in hindsight) I would get around to it and it would be too much pain for me...i felt really weak, and just like you I always thought there was no one to tell (i felt more than 100% certain at the time)

but that's were the good part comes in...there is always, and i mean ALWAYS someone to tell. it took me a while to realize what i thought then was actually bullshit, and in some sense i think your smart enough to realize that too. that's why you're posting here after all right?

if you look around the website there are hotlines provided for you, journals help as well. that's what helped me be more open  with people who i thought would never understand, i just typed a journal every night for a few months...it's practically like talking to a completely different person

I too am young, and i don't want to die, but sometimes i didn't want to live...but that's not rare, in fact it's freakishly common, when my depression came out I would have family who I hadn't seen in years (in fact some i was suprised to find that they were still alive!) flood in and they would tell me their depression story, and whats more...THEY WOULD LISTEN

unfortunately everyone is unique, so I can't lie to you and say I know absolutely exactly how you feel, but i can say I have felt enough to know that there is someone to talk to, and right now you need to talk, depression is scary and it can get worse if you let it, but you can also defeat it.

Tl;Dr: if you get one thing out of this speal, try writing/typing a journal/diary it helps more than it seems it would (almost alien like i swear) and make sure to talk to someone,  even if its a hotline, those things can save live...do this and you may just not want to die...and WANT to live

98729,,True,JakesGunReviews,,,,"Have never visited this subreddit before:  was just having a slow evening, hitting ""new"" on ""all subreddits.""

It lead me to your post.

I understand your being scared of social interaction.  However, my situation was somewhat different.  I wasn't so much afraid of social interaction so much as scared there would be *no* social interaction throughout the day.  I was naturally introverted, and still am to a degree, yet keeping to myself tended to make things worse.  I ""over-thunk,"" basically.  *""Maybe no one's talking to me because they really don't like me,"" ""maybe everyone ignores me because I'm stupid.""*  Interesting how, when alone, we tend to think so negatively about ourselves.  I know I sure did.

My freshman year of high school wasn't that great.  All of the athletically-inclined classmates got buddy-buddy with their varsity teammates.  Went to parties, did fun stuff.  I didn't.

I tried to, though.  I would attempt interacting with the more popular folks or those who were just generally more social in general.  I, having fewer social skills, of course, ended up making the conversations a little awkward.  I still have immense difficulty with ending a conversation, even if it has run its course by-far.  Obviously, this made things pretty crappy in high school.  After my ""conversations,"" I tended to beat myself up mentally for having said this-or-that or something.  I still tend to keep to myself because of it, and no, I am no longer in high school.  

This happened for the entirety of my freshman year, and, honestly, for the majority of my sophomore year.

What really helped me get through the day was finding a hobby.  Mine happens to be firearms, photography, and writing:  perhaps yours will be music, art, designing stuff (clothes, tools, whatever floats your boat), or perhaps photography, as well.  

To delve into that further, when people ask me about why I enjoy the shooting sports, it's hard for me to answer them honestly.  Since this is a semi-anonymous response, however, I will be perfectly honest with you.  I enjoy firearms because they have given me immense joy.  They are what I am good at naturally.  Being able to disassemble a firearm I have zero experience with and then reassemble it within the same hour brings me pleasure that few things rival.  I tinker:  I enjoy that kind of thing.  I also mentioned photography and writing.  During my Sophomore year, I created my website:  jakesgunreviews.weebly.com.  It combined my three greatest hobbies, and considering each page took about a week each for photography, research, writing, etc., it burned a *lot* of my time.  That time I used to spent loathing myself?  Spent it writing or doing photography.  

I mention this because I think it may help you.  Sometimes we are interested in things we didn't know we were interested in, so I wholly recommend you try your hand at a few different things and get out of your comfort zone a little bit, gradually.  See if you can't get a good set of colored pencils and a sketchbook.  Perhaps a cheap digital camera.  Maybe just a composition book to write down your thoughts of the day or stories that lift your spirits up a bit.  Anything to keep you from over-thinking like I once did (and perhaps you do, as well).  

Did me taking up my three favorite hobbies at once earn me friends?  Unfortunately, no.  At least not immediately.  Since I was so overtaken by these hobbies, however, my mind was not on that.  I went about my school day as normal, focusing on the work and not so much the people.  As I got more involved with people who did the same things I did outside of school, my confidence built.  My in-class participation improved, as did my communication skills from having spoken with those who shared the same hobbies as myself.  I still cannot speak to complete strangers about things I don't know well, nor can I speak 100% comfortably to large groups about things I do know relatively well.  However, I am still far better off than I was back in 9th grade, I can tell you that.  Sometimes we have to think of it as a set of stairs:  you can't get to the top unless you've already started from the bottom.

From the bottom, the staircase does look quite tall:  you probably think it's going to wear you out.  I know I did.  Once you take that first step, though, and start doing things for *you*, exploring *your* interests, that staircase becomes one step shorter.  The more you focus on getting up the staircase, building talent in your hobbies and interacting with those who share the same hobbies (be it in person or online even), the faster you will climb those stairs.

It's also worth noting that, even though I was that ""weird gun kid"" in high school, I have had *countless* classmates approach me after we graduated asking me for assistance with firearm-related things.  I also made a fair number of friends my junior and senior year simply because people enjoyed the fact I did things for me:  I didn't try to become someone I wasn't just so I'd be popular.  I did what *I* wanted to do, and I think people really begin to notice that maturity as they themselves begin to mature.  Going back to photography, one of my other ""weird"" friends has always been hardcore into photography.  Was often told she obsessed over it.  She had her own photography business by the time she was a senior in high school:  don't let people talk you out of your passion.  Ever.

Part of beating my depression medication-free came from ignoring people who talked down to me or generally made me feel worse.  Another part was realizing that I, too, was one of those people.  Perhaps my own worst enemy:  I had little to no motivation.  Once I started delving further into photography and writing, though, I felt comfortable with myself.  I would see a photograph and say, *""Wow, great job, Jake:  I didn't know you could do so well so soon!""*  Sometimes I would say, *""Oh, I wish I would have done x-differently for this photograph, perhaps next time.""*  It made me feel compelled to continue building my photography skills and ignore everything else for that period of time.  Ditto for my writing:  I would critique myself, but made myself promise to say only constructive criticism about my own work, often times aloud just to *hear* compliments about myself, even if they were spoken from me.  It helped me, at least, and perhaps it will help you.

Lastly, with the parents:  it can be rough.  I know my mother, too, was a bit on the makes-no-sense-majority-of-the-time side, and it had its effects on me.  I felt as though I could never please her.  I did try my best, though, and I would often times have to tell myself that, just like I did with my writing.  She is one of those people who, no matter what happens, there is at least one thing worth complaining about, even if it has barely anything to do with what just happened.  It was hard getting past that, but I'm sure you can, too.  

My father understood the situation, but was one of those, ""I had it rougher and I did fine!"" types.  I eventually learned to recognize that this was his version of ""tough love.""  It sucked, but I knew that at least he was listening to me, otherwise he wouldn't have bothered comparing our childhoods.

Did I get the blame for problems?  Yeah, I did.  It sucks.  What helped me get through that was realizing that was how they dealt with their problems.  Did it make it okay?  No, screw them:  that's no way to go about it.  However, that *was* their way to go about it.  Because of this, I pushed myself to get through so if I ever had children, I could be sure they did not have those kinds of parents.  Seeing how they acted made me want to become a better person.

To sum up, I would say a lot of it is just learning what makes you tick.  We all change a lot from middle school to high school whether we're ready to admit it or not.  It will be equally tough at the end of high school, but only for folks who are not capable of being independent.  I think once you fight through this unfortunate period you are currently experiencing, you will appreciate the strength you have.  This will definitely boost your confidence as time goes on:  you can trust me on that.  Once you graduate high school, it'll make transitioning ""to the real world"" that much easier for you.  You know who you are and what you like, and that's what makes for a successful, strong, and independent person.

I have faith in you:  it'll just take a little time.  

Lastly (for real this time), please:  please feel free to send me a private message at **any** time.  I want to help you in any way I can.",,0.0,,2013-05-23 05:27:09,,,0,False,,,,0,,ca49kjq,,,,,t3_1evsie,,,t1_ca49kjq,,,,t3_1evsie,,,,,,,,1431063188.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

During my last relationship (which seemed quite serious,) I let my happiness become dependent on my significant other. Eventually, it came to the point I was so afraid of her leaving me, that I started to hold myself hostage. I would threaten to kill myself, hurt myself... I can't even remember my logic for feeling that way. It got to the point I almost hung myself and she had to steal her parents car to stop me moments before. After that I was admitted to a hospital, but here's the catch: They let me go with little treatment because I convinced them I wasn't actually depressed. And to no surprise, she left me. 

As such, ever since I can't remember the last time I was consistently happy. It feels like everyday I'm trying my hardest to be happy but it never comes. Even if I do become content with something, it's quickly ruined by my realization that I'll only be temporarily happy... and upon realizing that I'm happy, I'm violently thrown back into my depression. It's a vicious cycle. It's like a monster that only exists when I don't believe in it. 

It doesnt matter what I do now. Nothing seems to make me happy. I've gotten pretty heavily into drugs... seeking something (anything) to change my mindset. I just don't even know what COULD make me happy anymore.

Currently, I feel like giving up. I'm sick of everyday being a struggle. Every minute of my life I'm trying to be happy but it never comes. I'm running out of options and it almost feels like giving up would be the easiest solution. I'm not religious even the slightest and I'm not necessarily trying to escape this life... I just want a break. A break from this suffering. I'm weak. Broken. I feel like there's nothing I can do to fix it.

It's a good step.  But 16 to be having this is pretty scary, as you got a lot of new hormones and changes going on in your brain that can make *knowing yourself* pretty damn difficult.

&gt; We hang out more and more, until eventually I decide I'm going to break up with Amanda and date Sally again. So I do. And Amanda is a wreck. I feel terrible for her, the saddest I've been in a while, and I start wondering if I did the right thing. I go back to Amanda. I'm momentarily happy. Sally is a wreck now.

You are just flipping a coin over from heads to tails, tails to heads.  Look at what you are experiencing and saying.

Joseph Campbell, who was a college professor for over 40 years, on Love: ""**Love is the burning point of life, and since all life is sorrowful, so is love. The stronger the love, the more the pain. .... Love itself is a pain, you might say -- the pain of being truly alive.**""

There is no undoing what you did.  Running away via suicide - surely isn't going to make these two girls feel better.

You are growing up and learning - do your best, but accept that you are finding out the reality of the world the hard way.

I'd suggest you look at it like they courts do with Juvenal - you get off of it and hopefully recover quickly.  Maybe let them both go and walk away a much more mature *man* from the lesson you learned.  A lot of people screw up entire families at age 35 - never having learned what you have staring you in the face at *16*.

If it were the adult me who just learned this lesson at 16 - I'd go to both girls and say ""I screwed up, it was me, I am clearly learning the ropes of love - and I had handed to me a very serious lesson in leaving you {Sally / Amanda}.  I hope we can be friends in the future, I'm offering that, but there is no real way to undo what I did - but I am surely going to learn from the pain we all 3 experienced - and take a lot more care with others in the future.""

They will probably not react positively no matter what you do. such is the game of love, but you do your best.",,0.0,,2009-12-02 00:25:09,,,0,True,,,,0,,c0gjzrb,,,,,t3_aa1tb,,,t1_c0gjzrb,,,,t3_aa1tb,,,,,,,,1428166018.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

For example: people don't just leak water from their eyes when they cry, their faces get swollen and beet red, they get a snotty nose and they make the craziest faces and noises while doing so. I suggest if you want to see something realistic, you try some European movies, most of them are greasy-looking and handle real-life troubles with normal-looking people instead of some supermodels trying to save the world. I would like to suggest you [Hable Con Ella](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287467/), for one. GREAT movie. 

For further advice: you might pick up a hobby. Try to go outdoors, do something active, meet new people. You don't have to force yourself to be social or make new friends on the spot, just try to engage yourself into something that you'd like to do, develop a passion.

Second... I understand. 

This is not the first time you've posted about your recent troubles. In fact, I can see a definite trend starting two or three months ago, glancing at your profile. Your boyfriend, who you clearly love, is going through a rough time. You had some costly car damage. Now you're feeling like you're at the edge because you're 21 years old and life is just taking a big ol' dump on you before you can handle it. 

I'm 21, and also entering my senior year. I also have trouble sleeping. I've also been in a relationship where both parties had to deal with family issues and our depression/anxiety/insomnia. I was also worried to the core about how much I was hurting her. I spent more time than I needed to on the internet, as well. We broke it off after two and a half years. She was my first love. It took a while, but I got better. I still think about it every now and then, but I am alive. 

But you're going to be fine. I KNOW this. Because while you may feel desperate, you haven't given up. You have your own life ahead of you. It's yours, only yours, and you will do with it as you please. Even if your highest calling right now is to help others in /r/depression or lurking around /r/AskReddit. You posted a comment and extended a hand of friendship [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xf428/i_really_just_need_someone_to_fucking_care_about/) and even though there are other comments there, and even if nothing comes back to you directly, that OP will be thankful, and they will certainly miss you, because you helped remind them that people do, in fact, give a damn about their fellow human beings. 

You're going to be okay, but you need to remember: you can't be strong enough for everyone. You may feel like your boyfriend needs you, but *you* need you way more.

I have tried talking with friends, but most of them either don't understand, or just don't care enough.

I feel trapped. Currently, I am so unhappy with my situation that I am barely functioning. I would try to do something else, but I know that as soon as I gave up on school (currently a student) I would feel overwhelming guilty, or anxious. I had a panic attack not to long ago that put me in the ER, they asked if I had suicidal thoughts, but I lied and said no for fear of getting transferred three hours away to a mental health ward. 

My parents don't understand, my friends are so self absorbed that they don't get it, the people I do feel comfortable with often times do not or cannot provide enough support.

I feel very lonely and used as a friend with people who I feel give less than a shit about me. I don't really feel the need to be around anymore, as if I have already served my purpose, I feel pretty much worthless.

35310,,True,esther_mouse,,,,"Well, these tips are just an example. I assume you're talking about the ""Listen, empathise, and don't judge"" section? Whilst the examples there are focused on the way the individual feels about themselves, it can definitely be extended to the world as a whole instead.

I think the main point is that she feels bad, and however she expresses that, it's not pleasant to feel that way. Saying that ""the world sucks"" can be equated to saying that ""I suck"" in that it's her way of expressing how miserable she feels - obviously neither statement is correct, and she probably knows that, somewhere inside, but it's probably the only way she can make sense of her feelings at the moment. (or at least, the only way she can communicate them)

Unfortunately depression isn't logical, the feelings don't necessarily make sense, and the best way to help isn't necessarily straightforward. Being a constant, supportive presence is good. Letting her know you're listening and that you are concerned that she feels this way is a good start - it can help to establish that she's not as alone as she probably feels.

I think that asking how she feels isn't necessarily bad, as it shows that you're actually trying to understand rather than assuming. Does that make sense? For example, I greatly prefer my friend to ask me directly about things rather than guessing how I feel, or thinking I should be feeling a certain way.

The way she responds should be your cue for what to say next - the talking tips says:

&gt;Help them by naming the emotions that you hear in their story, but which they may not be expressing, nor fully aware of.  

&gt;Active listening, which demonstrates and refines your understanding, is a powerful rapport building technique. People in a suicidal state of mind usually feel profoundly alone. Saying “I understand” without proving it will often reinforce this sense of alienation. Some ways you can “actively listen” effectively are:  

&gt;Ask lots of open-ended clarification questions. This shows that you care about getting it right.
  
&gt;Summarise, paraphrase and interpret what you’re hearing. This shows what that you’re taking in what they’re saying, and thinking deeply about it. It also offers them the chance to correct anything that you got wrong.  

&gt;React genuinely and supportively. If you feel a strong empathetic response to what someone is telling you, share it. This shows that what they are going through matters to you, and that they’re getting through to you.  

&gt;Remember that you’re just building your understanding: suspend your judgement and listen. You may hear some ugly truths, or even ugly untruths. The point is to understand, to go to the dark place with them, and those dark places are often dirty, smelly and full of evil things. Be ready for that.  

I think the best way I can explain is with an example. The other day, I was feeling incredibly isolated, really sad and tearful and angry. I wasn't really sure why, but I was projecting this on to friend and my gaming companions in my head, and isolating myself even further as a result. Now, this isn't the same situation as your friend, but the fact that I was ""misinterpreting"" (for lack of a better word) the world as it is is the same.

So what happened?

My friend picked up that I was feeling bad, and kept asking me questions to get me to talk. Were all of the questions ""correct""? Hell no! However, he didn't assume anything, and when he got something wrong he accepted my alternative explanations. Likewise, this made me more receptive to what he had to say, which was basically that I'm not alone, and not unliked. It's a slow process, for sure, but the fact that someone actually cared enough to keep talking to me and try and understand *me* really helped.

One problem I have is that a lot of people misread me, and I misread them; I'm really bad at understanding what people's intentions are, what they're thinking, what they want. This seems to come naturally to a lot of people, but not to me, and it's a cause of some frustration. So you can see how my friend making an effort to understand was really helpful to me :)

Sorry for not being particularly coherent here, I only just woke up and my blood sugar's a bit low (I have type one diabetes), so I'm a bit all over the place. I'd really like to help more if I can; if you would be ok with giving some more specific information about what your friend says, etc, I could possibly give some more specific insight into what's going on in her head.

It sounds like her thinking is distorted, which is very, very common in unhappy people - but they feel as though it's true. Changing these perceptions is tricky, because when you feel something, it's your body trying to tell you something, right? I feel hungry, therefore I must have an empty tummy and need to eat. I feel cold, therefore it must be cold and I need a blanket. I feel alone, therefore I have no friends...but what is the solution? You can see how these things get taken for granted.

I'd suggest looking up some CBT worksheets - I wouldn't necessarily recommend getting her to read them, but it's a bit of insight into these distorted thoughts. [Here's an article](http://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/cognitive-distortions-cbt.htm) that kind of explains it.

Once again, this article is focusing on self-hatred and turning the negative feelings against oneself, but just switch ""I hate myself"" for ""I hate the world"". They're both negative, angry emotions and neither is necessarily the way the person is actually feeling - just how they're expressing their anger/sadness/frustration.",,0.0,,2013-04-04 18:37:02,,,0,False,,,,0,,c98gde4,,,,,t3_1bn7bu,,,t1_c98gde4,,,,t1_c98ewpf,,,,,,,,1431674210.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

I would post this in the PMDD subreddit, but it's largely inactive, and I need advice ASAP.))

I was recently diagnosed with PMDD. Essentially it's extremely bad PMS that involves full-on depression for a week, and often suicidal thoughts. I experience intense suicidal thoughts every month for a week before my period. Until I found out what PMDD is, I thought I actually had depression. Now that I know that it's just my stupid ovaries and that it'll all be over in a week, I feel a lot happier, and like I can cope with it. 

Still, I don't know what will happen. I worry that maybe I will have an awful month at some point, and when my PMDD kicks in I will lose control and do something drastic. Just for this one week a month, I feel like I need help. 

But I'm worried about telling my therapist. So many doctors and therapists have made me feel scared about explaining that I get suicidal thoughts sometimes. They always say ""We'll have to tell someone"". What happens? Has anyone here ever told a doctor about feeling suicidal? I'm worried about it affecting my role as a volunteer, or future job prospects. Any advice? ",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,default,Should I tell my therapist?

34401,,True,[deleted],,,,"haha, er.. no help. My sister was always the popular and socially graceful one (despite being far less intelligent), so I think they always wanted to shower their attentions on her, because she's easier to parent. I don't think parents realize the effect that not showing a single ounce of love to their kid can have... they worked me like a fucking packmule in school, because they knew how smart I was, but they had no idea how to help my social anxiety so they just ignored it and kept yelling at me about my 'terrible' A/B-level report cards. Never any advice, or even helpful words.. all they cared about was that the smart son kept working non-stop and getting A's, while the pretty daughter lived her life and partied every night.  

However, I think they know how I feel now. I'm very open about my MJ use, and i'm never really ashamed to tell anyone why I use it.. depression and loneliness  spring constantly throughout the day, and I'm left gritting my teeth and fighting of tears in work/in class without MJ to chill me out. Being stoned off my ass and emotionally apathetic to everything and everyone around me has been the only remedy I've found to the pain. It makes me a fucking badass engineer, to be quite honest, but being stoned is only white-washing the real source of pain in my life...

I only really have two friends right now. One I only see once a week for an hour or so. The other is a girl who has me brutally friendzoned.. I've had feelings for her if we met, but am mortified to tell her, because I'm almost certain it will lead to failure, and the loss of the first non-family female relationship I've had in 6-7 years. I want to tell her, but as any FA guy knows, even the slightest interaction with a girl gives a huge emotional rush, when you're used to years and years of nothing... and I'd rather take the emotional abuse than go back to being completely alone.

19635,,True,countingspoons,,,,"it seems like a lot of the breakdown in how you feel about yourself and your life, happened with this ex of yours.  For starters, is she out of your life?  It's ok to feel what you feel for her, its ok to love her and to have a hard time getting over her.  But you're taking steps backwards if you continue to reach out to her and try to bring her back into your life.  You only delay your eventual progress forwards, if you keep her around or contact her at all.

Relationships are funny things.  I hate that they are so much about power games, but, they are.  And the rules of the game are this = the one who cares the least (i.e. is less upset at the threat of losing the relationship) is the one who has the most power.  Clearly, she has the power, because she's the one who keeps breaking up with you, and you are the one who has been desperate enough (or in love with her enough) to keep taking her back on any terms, no matter how bad the treatment.  

Girls are funny things too.  They test you.  They want a strong man with confidence and a strong sense of self, and, they push your buttons to see what they can get away with.  It's a way of finding their power in the relationship, and its also a way of finding out if they can respect you.

When you take her crap and keep loving her anyways, when she dumps you and says hateful things to you, but you take her back later anyways, you are telling her that you are not the confident leader which she would find attractive.  She likes having the power, it feels good to reaffirm that you are there for her no matter how badly she behaves, but it lessens her attraction to you at the same time.  

Take it as a lesson and a bit of insight for the next relationship.  You love deeply, and that's a wonderful trait that I hope has not been spoiled by her.  But no matter how much you love, you have to be willing to walk away when you are being treated badly.  Not only for your own sake, but because you become unattractive when you take too much of a girl's shit.  You might as well wear a sign that says ""I am worthless, so why should you value me?""  Have standards for yourself, and by holding those standards and not compromising them, you teach a girl that you have worth.

Do you remember that offspring song?  ""The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care, right? yeah yeah yeah"" No, no it doesn't.

I feel that I'm hitting the surface of the problem though, and not the root issue.  The relationship is already gone, so, relationship help is probably not what you need - it's just what I know best.  

I agree with the other comment that suggested you might want to talk to a good therapist who can help you come to some insights into how you allowed yourself to be so broken down and devalued.  This stuff comes from inside first, and once you feel it, you will project it, and you will be ready for a new, better, more true love that will leave you wondering why you spent so much time on a girl that treated you so badly.

Thanks for posting!

I noticed you posted in askreddit...not a safe place to post to; you're safe here, so don't take the posters comments to heart there.

It is horrible when the person you're with suddenly does a 180 on you, and you don't even know this ""other"" person.

Okay, it's time to circle the wagons, so to speak. You need to make sure that you get someone else over there with you. The reason that you do this is so that you have a witness in case she tries say you hit her or some crazy thing like that.

You mentioned that you've never seen a lawyer before, so find out from some other guys that have gone through a divorce before you pick one out, so that you'll have an idea what to expect.

One thing that you have going for you is that she pulled that stunt right in front of your kids...that goes to show that she's unfit to be a parent. Her actions actually point to some possible mental issues; if it's a fight for custody for the kids, then you can insist on her getting a psychological assessment before you feel she'll be fit to even have joint custody.

Open another bank account right now, and start moving everything you can over to the other account. She'll get half anyway, but it's better you get your half before she just drains the accounts, and then you'll have to fight her for half.

Bottom line here is that no matter how much you think you know someone sometimes they end up not being the person that you think they are.

Now, let's help you out mentally. You have to be strong for not only yourself, but for your kids. Here are some coping techniques that might help you out, but I'm not going to kid around here that it's difficult to control your mind. Give them a try: Every time that you start to feel a negative thought enter your mind try this - simply breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. This is a very, very ancient technique that will cause your mind to lose focus on the negative thought for a split second, and that will lessen the impact of the thought. - If you are like me, I tend to do self talk about whatever negative thought comes into my mind. What I've found that helps to stop them is by simply clenching my teeth. This stops me from vocalizing my thoughts, and that prevents the negative thought from affecting me as much. - This next technique is very effective, and that is you think of the funniest thing that you can remember, and every time a negative thought enters your mind you think of the funny thought instead. Stay away from the booze, or anything else that can alter your mood. Additionally, keep away negative movies, or comics...you need to watch comedy, and continually seek out anything that is humourous, and funny.

Please continue to post here, and we're here to help you.

The complete emptiness of it all. How little i really matter in the grand scheme of things and also to those around me. Everyone who i care about now hates me. I am an insufferable human being with little to no regard for others, which i have accepted through years of councilling to be my own fault. If i wanted to change my ways i would have done so, so she was right to leave me.

She left me 48 hours ago. It was amicable. We talked it over, she wasn't happy, i was happy (whatever the fuck that is), but it's okay, i don't want to be with her if she's not happy. Now, why was she not happy? Her words exactly, ""I do not like you as a person, you are, quite frankly, a horrible human being."" I know this. I accept this. This is me, a person who tries to help people. I helped her with her rather severe mental health issues for years. I have always hidden my true ""emotions"". We've been talking alot recently and she wanted in. So, after years of persuasion, i let her in. Two days later, she dumps me. But hey, i knew it would be too much to handle for her, my feelings of pure anger all the time. I feel them about any little thing. I felt angry and violent around her. I never hit her. I never laid a hand on her. But, she always knew that i was holding back, with great effort. I am a horrible human being.

Now, today i log into my laptop to play around with some internet settings (wifi wasn't working), i fix the issue and i check it's working by logging in, naturally, to my most visited website, facebook. I havent used my laptop since she left. She's logged in. I cannot resist. I check her messages. She's already having ""casual fun sex"" with some dude. That, i cannot accept. Who the fuck turns around after 5 years and sleeps with someone else within 24 hours? 

Over the past few days i've been coming up with ideas on how to solve the issues i have in my head. My one ""friend"" (dude i live with who i speak to maybe 4 times a month) thinks that going on a trip might be a great way to get some distance and relieve the stress of my daily life. Clear my head, so to speak. Well, being a dude who got kicked out of college just before christmas with 30 grand of debt and enough money to buy food with for 3 weeks, i really can't do that. Hell, i have to pay rent in 3 weeks time also.

So, to summarize, i'm done. Everyone i have ever cared out goes out of their way to crush the life out of me. The one girl who i have ever truly cared about or felt any emotion about at all, leaves me to go sleep around. 

So with that, i am done. I've already done half my bottle of scotch in the time of writing this. I will finish it, and then i am going to go walk in the snow for the few miles to the cliffs.

Even if you're silently nibbling at a vanilla icecream with a friend on a sunny day on a roadside, it's better than crying alone at home.

Do you have a religion? If so, look beyond the dogma and the rules and regulations to see what is behind that religion. For Buddhism it's helping others and learning more about the world and acknowledging consciousness at a global level, the interconnectedness of life. Each religion has a story, something beyond the doctrine that our subconscious acknowledges. That's why we intuitively have faith in them.

I saw this thread and thought I would jump in. Hope you dont mind. I think what you are describing is one of the hardest things to deal with in life. The thing is, its kind of a paradox, you cant live a full life without doing some things you regret, and yet regret makes you heavy, drags you down. For myself, I had to seperate out being happy from the regrets  I obtained simply from living. I found that exercise, my gf, going out sometimes but not too much - make me happy. But now and then I revisit things in my past, sometimes on purpose, sometimes not. They are there, but I dont let them overwhelm me - and at some point I will let them go. 

I would suggest that given your statements that you suggest finding things to do that are positive and try and avoid dwelling on the negative. When the negative comes, let it come but know that one cannot live a full life without having some regret.

I understand your reluctance to admit your suicidal feelings for fear of being hospitalized.  I'm very careful about that sort of thing too, because I've been there and it sucked.  It's so humiliating, and ultimately unhelpful, to be dragged off by the cops to be held ""for your own good"" because you made the mistake of telling somebody how you really felt.  Still, if it starts to feel like you're really going to do it, I'd encourage you to tell somebody anyway.

I learn new things everyday and I get to see a lot of fun and interesting people. I just browse though and never really posted. Reddit was one of the few things that kept me going, and I guess I'm more comfortable telling reddit this than any of my friends or family. Please let me tell you a story that I've never told anyone. 

For the past few months I've been looking for a job with no luck and if I don't find any in the next 30 days, they would kick me out. I'm 22 with no job experiences, no license, and no car. I've been living in the USA for 5 years, I was born in the Philippines but my mother married my step-dad and we moved to the US. It's not the I am unhappy here, but I've yet to be truly happy either, if I could still even remember how that really felt like.

After trying college for a couple of years and see if that changes who I am, I found it to be unsuccessful and if anything just worsened my condition to the point where sometimes when I wake up and find out that I'm still living, I tear up and be really disappointed.

I went home to my parents hoping I could change again, it got a bit better, I was able to take a couple of semesters of school again, but because of some financial issues with the college I had to stop. I haven't been in school for a several months now, and I guess my parents just had enough of me not doing anything but being locked up in my room and just being in my computer most of the time. I don't blame them.

It's not like I dislike my parents though, I love my mother, she raised me even though I'm sure she has had the same thoughts as I have back then. I don't dislike my step-dad either, I think he's a good man and he loves my mother, I guess we can't just see eye to eye, he is very traditional in terms of issues like these, just like my mum. I don't think they even believe that depression is even a real thing, so it's even harder for me to tell them or use that as a reasoning why I act the way I do.

It's not like I haven't been trying to be a decent son though. I've been searching for a job for months now, I applied in most of the locations I could walk to from my parents place, and since I have no connections to people around here I rely on internet job searches to apply. I have had no luck, but I guess my step-dad believes it's just my lack of effort. He'll always just tell me that when he was around my age he left his parents and found a job anywhere and it was easy. I really wish it was that easy, or maybe he's right and I just don't do enough effort.

A year ago when I was still living on my own, before I decided to come home to my parents again I set a date to kill myself. After lots of thinking I decided to give it a chance to get better, so I moved back in with them and for a good amount of time it did get a bit better. Lately it hasn't been easy though and I don't think I will be able to convince myself like I did last time. I feel like even though things might get better, eventually I would feel like this again, and it gets worse as I go on longer. I'm not confident enough that I would find a job or change within 30 days, I am contemplating suicide for the 2nd time now, and I don't think I can pretend to be happy anymore. I think I've given up reddit, what do I do?

I can't succeed at anything. I don't remember the last time that I found something that I was actually good at. Every time I try to do something, I either fail or there is someone else who can do it far better than I can, thus making my skill worthless (and much less the latter than the former). I've tried with everything I have to find a reason to go on, but I can't find one. I can't even divine why I can't do anything. It feels as though I was just born to be a failure and nothing more. I apologize for the string of ""fail fail fail"", but that's really all my life is at this point. And after 17 years of the same shit, I've gotten sick of it.

I'm not really close with my family. I dislike them and I have a hunch that they dislike me. I've never had any real and true friends, and the one person that I could actually tell things to without a scornful or negative reaction did more harm to me than good. I have no base of support whatsoever. I go to school every day and put up the bullshit mask of laughing and being happy and whatnot, and come home every day with the same mask up for my parents. Then I go to my room and the mask comes down, and thus commences the revelation of a piece of shit. I've only really hurt the people that I've come into close contact with, hence my lack of friends. I enjoy solitude, but there is a difference between being the only person in a room and being utterly, truly, irrevocably ALONE.

The worst part is this. The only place that I have EVER felt safe is in the solitude of my room. Now, even that's gone. I don't even feel safe in my own head. I can't concentrate on anything because of thoughts of suicide relentlessly haunting my mind. It's been around 6 months or so since I've had a dream that didn't involve me killing someone in my life by some method or other and then doing the same to myself. I get into a conversation about something and every 5-10 seconds I'll lose focus and have to ask the person to repeat themselves or reiterate what I was saying.

I've lost interest in everything. My passions are extinguished, to be replaced with a lethal obsession. I don't find myself caring about any of the things I used to love. Theatre, acting, pretty women, gaming, music, singing, none of it. Nothing distracts me anymore. And I say that because life has become the would-be distraction, and death the norm.

I can't do this anymore. I have no hope left. I've often heard suicide described as ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" I disagree with this statement. From my point of view it is a permanent solution to a permanent problem. Sorry for the bitching.

I'm stuck in a job I hate and have been trying to get out for a while now. I keep sending out resumes and have had no response.

I'm stuck.

Also, of course, there's a guy. I met him online, we hooked up, he ignored me for about 6 months and then came back to have a ""strictly sexual"" relationship. I said ""yes"" because, of course, I'm convinced he's perfect for me other than being an obvious jerk. I could go on and on about how much this situation is affecting me right now and I can even justify his behavior (his job does have him on call, I don't know how long it takes to put out a wildfire though...). I stopped eating and I like the pain I'm feeling. I also started taking Nyquil to sleep without dreaming. I even like the numb feeling I feel the entire next day.

I'm very tired and I don't know how to be happy anymore. I keep thinking about how I'm going to kill myself.

I asked my friend for help, and he said ""I want to help you, if it's easy"". He was my best friend for years, right up until I read that. If I need more than the occasional minute of talking, apparently it's too much and he would rather see me leave. I came out to him just a few days ago, and he said we could talk if I felt I needed to. I tried, and he ignored me.

I'm afraid to come out to anyone else, and I don't have anyone else to ask for help. He was my best friend, and the only person I really trusted enough to talk to about this, and he broke my heart, really.

Times like now, I feel like I could kill myself to sto feeling bad, and nobody would care. I feel like maye my best friend would even welcome being left alone, because he wouldn't have to hear me ask for help again.

The catch 22 here, and I do understand this, is that when you're depressed, making yourself happy isn't even a goal that's easy to set. I'm in that boat right now. But perhaps trying new things will help pass the time in a good way.

**phew**

Alright.  So, I've had suicidal thoughts before.  It's nothing new.  I used to have them a lot when I was a kid.  I especially had them a lot in college.  After I graduated, I knew I wouldn't suddenly get a job and start making money to support my life forever, but I was hoping to at least support myself.

My friends have moved away and gotten jobs with corporations in their preferred fields.  I haven't spoken with them in at least two years.  They still talk to each other.  And several talk to my ex, who they know was a gold digger that deluded me into thinking I could buy her love.  I don't consider those ones friends.  I don't really think I have any anymore.

I'm trying to get into a Masters program with little luck.  This will be my second attempt to get into the program.  I've tried to join groups that meet weekly to become more social.  I've exercised regularly and gotten in shape.

But money soon became an issue even though I still live with my parents.  So now I'm working three jobs, two regularly scheduled and one by contract.  I just feel so tired.  I'm making less than $700 a month.  I wake up, eat, work, eat, sleep, repeat.  I've had to stop exercising.  I've had to stop attending some of the social groups.

I have a loving girlfriend who adores me.  She has her own worries and works while trying to (unsuccessfully) finish college (mostly due to her dyslexia that the school won't help her with).  My family loves me, but they never show it.  We keep to ourselves except for my mom who seems to constantly need to know everything and is offended at any response.  For example, I was ironing my clothes for work and she offered to do it.  I said I was already doing it and she huffed out of the room and started complaining to my dad.

I don't feel sad.  I don't feel depressed.  I just don't feel anything.  Before I would get devastatingly sad before thinking suicidal thoughts.  Now it's more like I just want everything to stop.  I want to relax.  I want to just fall asleep and never wake up.  Again, I don't feel one way or another, I just don't see the point in continuing.

I normally push past this and just keep working.  Like I've mentioned, I don't have a horrible life.  I may not have mentioned much about my past and whatnot, but that's mostly out of lack of a drive to write more than I already am.  I'll probably still push past it.  It's just that I thought I was away from these kinds of thoughts.  Now that they're back and they make sense I thought I ought to try this out.  I'll probably counter most convincing arguments.  I learn and grow understanding through debate and conversation.  So I can't promise to be an 'easy patient', but I'll be as nice as I can be even though I'll probably be frustrating.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,self,What life?,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2o4u9e/what_life/,

my family has basically sided with him. and they don't know about this latest stunt, they just see him as the hero because my son lives with him. I'm effectively a meth head/stripper to them because I don't have custody of him.  

When his dad and I split, I didn't even have a passport, so I couldn't have taken him back to my country even if I had money to. Which I didn't because I didn't even have an ATM card or a bank account. 

my 'family' has sided with my son's father anyway.  they are so desperate to keep an appearance of normalcy, and also since my son's father has custody of him, they suck up to him so they can see pictures of my son.

hence my almost unbearable feelings of betrayal and abandonment.

no one gives two shits about my crushing pain, and I've about given up on these people.  

also, I have told no one in my family even thing ONE about what my son's father has done lately. I'm not interested in shit stirring, and I know there would be no sympathy anyway. I have literally one person to talk to about this. and it's like an acid eating away at me and spilling out of the cup. 

Appearances are very important in my 'family' .They all suck up to him on fb and tell me I should be nice to him because he's a single parent and I'm basically just extraneous, and a failure because i don't send him more money. 

my husband is a saint.  he's the only thing i have. and this depression of mine is impacting our ability to have a child of our own. and i don't know if I can even emotionally cope with day to day life as it is now, much less if I got pregnant.  i genuinely feel/believe that I am a failure as a human being. and this has come after 3, 5, 8 years of trying.

I don't have any more 'try' left in me. some days I sleep 13 hours a day and can barely lift my arms to make dinner.  i'm not kidding, some days, making my husband's lunch for work is my biggest fucking accomplishment and it feels like a massive achievement.

It ended a couple weeks ago but today was the final move out day. 
I was ALONE 10+ years before this.. and as crummy as the relationship was.. at least I was no longer alone. 
Now that's changed. She even took the dog that I loved. 

I know the fate of a 42yo guy finding someone (Especially someone young enough to have a family with) is just most likely not going to happen.
It's what I wanted in life. I wanted a wife to love.. to love me..
kids to love.. to love me. 
I can't go back to living alone, few friends in this dark empty house.

I thought I might be ok with this..over the last couple weeks but I realize now, I was only not freaking out because she wasn't officially out, and I knew I was going to see her again.
Today that stops and I know, no one will be visiting me.
No one will be checking up on me. 
I CANT even think about living another 30+ years alone in life.
I just wont do it.

I've seriously thought about ending my life before..
but I'm being honest when I say.. I honestly think Im going to do it.
There is nothing left for me.
If I was in my 20's, I'd have all the hope in the world.. all the time in the world.

I have guns in my home, but I think I'm just going to simply put a belt around my neck. 
The sad and pathetic part is if I dont do this before her final and very last visit tonight or tomorrow (we aren't talking)..
I bet I end up hanging for 2+ weeks before anyone even notices.

Thats the story of my life.
If people like kurt cobain or robin williams felt like they didn't have enough to live for.. jesus christ!... my life is a sad pathetic excuse for a life.

Not like a Twilight vampire, but with his wit &amp; charisma.  Could he achieve more in life?  Absolutely... but I have loved him 11 years &amp; he has made more progress than I think he can see.  For him... he needed me.  Apologies for that sounding stupid.  I think perhaps you need someone who will see all of the wonderful things about you &amp; will inspire you to become more than you are... for them, even if not for you.  He... he told me he always loved that about me &amp; that it made him want to be a better man.

So I'm currently working a part time job making minimum wage. I'm trying to go to school for computer science and find a good job so I can move out and create a good life for myself. My parents and I are poor and we can't afford college. I thought that FAFSA would give me enough money to go to school since my family make such little income but it turns out, I wouldn't even get enough through FAFSA to get me through 1 class let alone anymore than that. 

I been looking to move out but I can't afford too since I make just enough money for my car insurance, phone bill, and groceries. I been looking for better jobs online but I can't find any computer jobs that I could get without a degree. Actually, I can't really find anything without a degree. Not only am I not able to afford school but my car has been getting worse and it's almost near the point where I can't afford to fix it but I also can't afford to just buy a new one. I can't get a loan for a car either since I don't have anyone that wants to co-sign. 

Despite all that, my girlfriend is going to college and is going to be an engineer. She will be graduating in a year and she is probably going to get a good job and move away. It's hard enough that I can't go to school, get my car fixed, can't find a better job, but now I feel like my girlfriend will leave me because I'm in such a bad situation. I wouldn't blame her for leaving because I have nothing to offer and I told her that I'm sorry that she has to watch me go through all this.

I started feeling depressed over a year ago, when my best friend (of 8 years) cut off contact with me. I came out as bisexual to him and he hated the idea so much that he decided he didn't want anything to do with me any more, and I haven't spoken to him since. It blew my mind that someone I trusted for so long, who was a pretty intelligent and open-minded guy otherwise and who I had shared a lot of other things with could change his tune so quickly. I already had trust issues before this so this didn't help those at all. 

Anyway after a couple of months of depression I somehow managed to make a few more friends. We became really close and after a few months I was actually for the first time in my life feeling happy. It felt amazing to know there were people who actually liked me enough to spend time with me. I quit my antidepressants, stopped seeing my therapist and felt great knowing my life was finally going somewhere. But then for reasons I never figured out (although I have theories) they also cut off contact and turned hostile towards me, which destroyed my progress and left me in the same position I was in before, only worse. This situation is especially painful because I know I'm being strung along - they haven't explicitly told me to go away like my best friend did, they just make excuses and won't be direct to give me false hopes. And because they promised me that they wouldn't do the same thing he did, and that I could trust them and that they'd be there for me, which were all lies. 

It probably sounds dumb that I'm getting upset about this but I have big underlying problems with loneliness, self-esteem and trusting people so my interpersonal relationships are really important to me. I keep failing and I don't know if it's because I'm a faulty person or if this kind of manipulation and cruelty is what I should expect from everyone I deal with.

So many of my classmates have big firm jobs, impressive clerkships, or influential work, but I know that will never be an option for me because of my grades.

I wanted so badly to leave my home state. I have no network in New York, and even if I did, I don't have the confidence or charisma to make a difference. My pretty amazing boyfriend broke up with me last week after we tried the long distance thing, hoping it would only be temporary until I could find something in New York or close enough. 9 months is a long time to ask a person to wait.

All my life, I had been touted as ""the smart one"" of the family, as if to justify my appearance in the face of my skinnier and more attractive siblings. Ever since high school, I dreamed of attending law school, and everyone told me along the way that I was a perfect fit for the law, I would do well in life, and make them proud. If they saw me now and knew my situation, I don't think I could bear their disappointment. My father's evident disappoint is bad enough -- he had been so proud of my past accomplishments and future intentions. So had I, but now I feel like it has been all a waste. I'm in a hole and I can't see myself digging out.

I want to give up. I don't want to be a burden on my parents anymore. I can feel my skills and intellect wasting away. I just want the pain to stop and I don't want to feel this incredible shame, hopelessness and resentment anymore. Suicide crosses my mind everyday.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post something like this, but I didn't know who else or where else to spew this all. I don't know what I'm hoping for or what could possibly help, but what the hell, right?

Be yourself, and to hell with anyone who wants you to change.  We love whom we love, we are who we are, and there should be no shame in that.

Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

For the dieting,I'm just counting calories. It's amazingly simple :D. I'm not even eating that low cal, I'm actually pretty much never hungry between meals, and I'm losing between 0.3 and 0.4kg a week. Not huge numbers but since I can still eat chocolate and go to the fast food once a week, it's an ok weight loss. My Fitness Pal is great for that if you want to give it a try ! The positive thing in all that is for the first time in my life, I'm not turning to food for comfort. It's quite the victory. As for working out instead of portion control...

I actually didn't want to post, but I can't take it anymore. I really can't. And I'm sorry I have to write it down so that people will have to read it. And I'm sorry I have to rant. I lost a very good friend because of my depression because the negativity pushed him away, so I try not to rant too much to the people I'm close to. But I think recently I'm pushing these same people's patience due to my circumstances. So.. I'm sorry but I will have to rant to you strangers here. I'm sorry.


I'm turning 25 tomorrow and I think my life is a major fuck up. 


I've been depressed since I was probably around 14 but I've had 2 major episodes in the past with some very near relapses. And I'm afraid I might just have a third episode soon. I do have a therapist, but I don't see him often because money is an issue. On the other hand, I can't really talk to most of my family because they don't believe in depression, while my sister, whom I'm close to, lives on the other side of the world. I have to hide it all the time, so, well, I guess I look to them as someone with weak and extremely poor character. 


To be honest, I'm not exactly a failure in life. Logically I know my case is most likely light, but I can't help feeling the worst ever creature to ever step on this world. I don't understand why I have to live, but I promised a few people I will live and so I'm still here. But recently, I think I might just give in to the temptation to jump over my balcony and plunge 9 floors down. Because you know, release. 


But you know, I'm sure people will say I don't have a reason to die. I mean.. I guess you could say I'm smart. I recently graduated from university with first class honors. Sure, not a 4.0 -- I can only dream, but it's a first class honors? That's good right? Even if it's from a no-name university? (While my siblings graduated from famous ones.. Hah)


Essentially, I have deep self esteem issues. I hate myself. I hate myself with a burning passion because I can never do things that I ought to do. I'm afraid of calling people on the phone, I don't like socializing/networking, I am not the daughter my parents will ever want to be. I can never be thin enough either because I'll forever be overweight, because I see no point in exercising if I'm going to eat excessively whenever I'm stressed. I'm not obese, more of what you can call thick. But lately, only sugar keeps me in some semblance of ""happy"", and with more sugar, hello weight gain.  


See, my main issue now is job search. But I hate selling myself because I don't see anything worthy of selling from myself. I don't have any work experience because I was ordered to NOT work and focus only on my studies while in school (so how come I don't have a 4.0? Lol). Either way, touching my resume feels like I'm grabbing a porcupine. Writing a cover letter makes me feel like I'm talking on hot air, and going to interviews feels like a farce. 


It's not that I don't want to work. I do, but I don't know what the hell I want, and I'm afraid I might hate the job so much I get a relapse. Did I mention I'm currently close to a relapse? I nearly had one 3 months ago when my dad forced me to go back home and help him with his work. It was free labour with no pay in a town I call my hometown but that is more like ""strangeland"" to me. Then, I was so tempted to raid my parents' medicine cabinet and take everything I found there. 


And now, while I'm back in a place I call home... I feel like everything I do is a fuck-up that is not worth my living. I mean c'mon, 11 years of depression? When is it ever going to improve? As in, for example, I lost 2 of my cats this year -- I just lost one that has been with us for 14 years 10 days ago. Now, everyone in the family seems to be back to normal while everything I'm supposed to do I screw up.

You might just be able eventually to get back on track (either by recovering physically or by recovering mentally).

Here are some things you can do with your life in the long term:
- Become a psychotherapist.
- You can do theoretical physics and/or mathematics.
- You can do practical philosophy. Philsophers really do get jobs. Where I live, in Israel, there's such a thing called military philosopher.
- You could be a writer (if you suddenly start to like it)
All of those things require an academic background.

We're both 20. I'm at a very prestigious school with a very solid future set up and she's, well, doing nothing. Since march of this year she had talked about wanting to get back into school, since having dropped out two years prior. So she moved to the nearest city and got into school. Almost immediately our relationship took a dive. Long story short, after 1.5 years with who I thought could very well be the one, she dropped me. Then she started drinking excessively, cutting, and dropped out of school again after not even attempting her midterms. She got a sense of freedom and met so many people that she didn't care about anything anymore, including me. Shortly after our break up she slept with an engaged guy with a pregnant girlfriend. A guy that got her pregnant right out of high school and will be working registers the rest of his life. Then shortly after that she (presumably since i finally had the sense to cut her off) started a relationship with a guy that's been doing nothing since finishing high school for five years and likely will continue that way. All she does now is go to work and screw this new guy. And she's probably as happy as she's ever been.

I wish she would say something. Anything. I would never take her back nor do I want to. But her getting over me so quickly, and then forgetting about me even faster, while i still miss the friendship dearly is murdering me. I wish I could stop fucking thinking about this so badly.

I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. I have literally zero expectations or signs that Ill ever find anyone better.

I hate school. I can't leave it because of the incredibly financial aid i have there, but i feel absolutely sick to my stomach thinking that i have 1.5 years left there. Im already dreading the next two weeks ending and going back there

All I feel throughout the day is misery. I thought coming home would fix it, but coming home to a tiny town with nothing to do while my parents, who I love and wanted nothing more than to get comfort from, are both gone for the holidays. Im alone, just like I will be for the rest of my life.

I got sleeping pills prescribed before I came home and I have about 50 of them left. I honestly think today is finally the day I stop thinking about this shit. I see no reason to go on. Yes, I know the selfishness thing. That wont convince me because Im fully convinced that nobody would give a shit for more than a week while i go on being miserable for years. I just wish I had one fucking 'sign' that things will get better. I started off writing this composed, started crying halfway through, and now Im calm and at peace with just giving up.

My life has completely fallen apart, In highschool I was ""the guy who could get the best blow, extacy , weed whatever, my friends where pretty much return customers who would come over and get high at my place because they couldn't at home. But anyways a year ago I'd say I hit rock bottom, I moved out and went off to college, I spent the entire year so fucked up I barley remember what happened. I started missing school to stay home and get wasted I hardly saw anyone accept my violent acholic roommates who would only try to start fistfights with me. My girlfriend started coming around less and less and eventually left me telling me she would have left me earlier if she wasnt so terrified of me because of the violent pyscopath i had aparently become. These where the people I grew up with and I thought where my best friends treating me like shit day after day. I guess something in me snapped because I sold off the last of my blow and what have you and bought a motorcycle thinking id meet new people, it would take my mind off things and I could kind of... Start over. So I bought a motorcycle decided to take a year off and ""find myself"" or whatever. Since then I've just been scraping along the bottom of the barrel. Its been over a year since Ive spoken to anyone I consider a ""friend"" I didn't meet anyone on my motorcycle going to meets or whatever I'm like only one even close to 20 who seems to own one in all of Canada.

77992,,True,[deleted],,,,"My first serious girlfriend cut. I managed to get her to stop; there's better ways to work shit out. Before I was on the scene (before I even knew her) she had attempted and failed suicide. She got put in a mental... I can't remember the word. Institute? Hospital?

Anyway, a few months into the relationship I was thinking of ending it as I wasn't happy with her (not because of her past, because she was a bitch, but that's a different story). But then, she started spiralling down.

She started cutting again. I could see she was crumbling. I had to try so hard to keep her going each day. I was having to remove pills from her room. I was removing razor blades. I was doing all this, and then I realized one day that I couldn't break up with her; I was the only reason she was still living. Although I no longer felt love for her, she was completely into with me. I knew that if I broke it off with her, she would commit suicide and it would be my fault.

One day, something snapped (I can't remember exactly what happened) and I ended it with her. It didn't sink in until the following day that I might have just killed someone. Now, she was semi-long-distance; it'd take me at least 2 hours on trains to get to her house, and I was 16. Travel wasn't easy. I was very busy for the next week or two, and couldn't go visit her. The next few weeks, hell, the next year were so hard.

If you are seriously considering suicide, you have no idea. **No idea**. How hard it is for the people around you. I was 16. My (ex-)girlfriend was probably going to attempt to kill herself. It was, in a way, my fault.

To people you're close to - to your girlfriend, to your friends, hell, to your ""controlling"" mother - it would be *devastating* if you committed suicide. I don't think it's really possible to grasp how big the effect on others is, until you are one of those others. I hope you never have to go through that experience, but just please trust me on this. Life may seem bad, it may seem pointless, your mother may seem like she's ruining your life, your girlfriend may seem to be the only person who'd be upset if you died, but **NO**.

People care about you. Your mother cares about you. I don't care if you think she's overprotective, that's no reason to inflict such pain on everyone who knows you. Speak to her. If you already have, speak more. If that doesn't work, there are *so many other options*. Things can seem impossible; problems can seem insurmountable. Once more, you're going to have to trust me when I say this: There's another side waiting over the hump for you. And it's fucking fantastic. It's called life.

Don't you dare go killing yourself.",,0.0,,2012-11-09 23:37:38,,,0,False,,,,0,,c6z19ci,,,,,t3_12xr64,,,t1_c6z19ci,,,,t3_12xr64,,,,,,,,1430365560.0,,4,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,4,,

20027,,True,SQLwitch,,,,"I can imagine how exhausted you must be.  There's nothing more draining than walking around with a heart that's tied to someone unattainable.

But when we can't get over someone, it's usually not the person themselves, but what they've come to be inextricably associated with in the backs of our minds that we can't let go of.  If we can disentangle that, it frees us to move forward.  It often happens especially with a first relationship that ends when we didn't want it to.  What we experienced with that person were things that we never experienced with anyone else, so it can seem natural to believe that those experiences *belong* to that person, and we can't have that with anybody else.  Even if we logically know different, our hearts aren't always very logical.

But *everything* we experience is inside our heads.  We have no way of knowing that we aren't brains in vats in some lab somewhere.  Maybe your ex is actually a subroutine that some alien in a six-sleeved labcoat wrote to mess with you when he was procrastinating about finishing his dissertation.

But what she *meant* to you, what she still means to you -- that's real either way, and sacred.  And it's *yours* even if she isn't.  

We all have a part of ourselves that identifies with the opposite gender; we need it for psychic wholeness.  Sometimes, for straight people, the first opposite-sex relationship awakens our awareness of that part of ourselves, and when the relationship ends, we think the ex has taken that essential part of us with them, and we feel hopelessly incomplete.  And if that's happening, then it makes ""emotional sense"" to feel like if we can't get that person back, we can never be whole.  And being in that state tends to make other potential partners shy away from us; they either tend to feel like they'd be taking somebody else's place or that they'd get sucked into a vortex of our need.

The only cure I know is a painful one; increasing our awareness of everything that we associated with the lost one.  If you get on the path of looking deeply into the depths of your grief, the pain doesn't ease right away but it changes.  You know how when you have a cut or a burn or a sprain, at first the pain is filled with a sense of ""something's wrong"" that makes us want to pull away from it.  And then it reaches a point where it changes to a ""healing"" sort of pain that feels like progress even though it still hurts, and then we know it's really getting better.   I think it's similar for psychic injuries.  

Sometimes we gain that awareness by sharing our pain with others; their understanding can help us understand ourselves.   When you say you want her to miss you, it sounds like your instincts are telling you that you need understanding.  And you're probably right about that, but it doesn't need to come from your ex.  So, if you can keep talking about this, keep looking into it, keep seeking the awareness of what you lost, that will help you get through the mourning process.

And it *is* mourning.  The hopes and dreams you had for the relationship with her have died, and that can be more devastating than the death of a person.  And getting stuck in one of the stages of grief for a year or two or five or ten is not uncommon, and it doesn't mean you're a failure or a loser, just that the circumstances arranged themselves to hit you in a particularly vulnerable spot (and *everybody* has some of those!).

10781,,True,SQLwitch,,,,"If you operate on the assumption that good circumstances (good university, nice apartment, friends, etc.) should determine how you feel on the inside, then you may end up setting yourself up in a position where you blame yourself for feeling pain that's beyond your control.  And then you don't get better, and you end up blaming yourself for that ""failure"", and it gets into this horrible pattern that's both a vicious cycle and a downward spiral where you feel worse and worse. 

See, here's the thing.  *Everything* we experience is inside our heads, and although our outer circumstances can influence that, they don't completely determine it.  And a healthy relationship with our emotions is one of complete surrender; we feel whatever we feel, and we need to honour that first.  It's by honouring our feelings and making them sacred for whatever they are that we can eventually transcend them; it's one of those paradoxical Zen things.  

If you have the expectation that your family will claim that they've got it worse if you open up to them, you're probably right.  But that is the most disrespectful thing you can say to a depressed person.  But you probably learned from them not to honour your feelings, and I suspect that's contributing to not just how depressed but also how ""stuck"" you are feeling now.  

And the second most disrespectful thing is saying ""I know how you feel"" without actually *demonstrating* any understanding.  

&gt; What the fuck am I to do?

You need and deserve some real understanding.  You deserve for somebody to listen to you until *you* feel understood by them.  I don't know where you'll find that; maybe here, maybe you'll need to reach out somewhere else, too.  But it's great that you've started.  Sometimes that's the hardest thing.

After I finished everything I was assigned to do, what should I do next? Hmm, it seems like everyone ends their life with death, so the only viable thing to do next would be suicide.

I'll give you some advice for the next time you encounter a suicidal person: Give them something to do. Whether it's clearing land or doing house chores, take their mind off of things by making them do manual labor. Don't give them work that asks them to think.

Like being able to deal with the world because I could look through a window instead of having to be stuck outside in it, if that makes sense. I imagine that not having that at all would be really damaging. I think losing it due to a family member would seem like a gross betrayal.

I'm not sure I could begin to suggest what else you could do. The closest thing for me would be something like a library, but that's not really like having your own computer at all and honestly, I don't think something like that would be all that helpful when you feel like life is torturous.

If you're interested in something like this, there may be some kind of help through your college. A counselor or maybe a referral to someone who can offer some guidance. It would be human contact and I don't know if it would even help. I apologize if you've considered it or sought it out already.

The bond is never right. They say they understand. I can feel that they don't.



I went to him for love after my suicide attempt failed; he stripped me naked. He fucked me while I cried. Then he dropped me back at my parents' house. I sat on my bed, catatonic.

I saw a street prostitute. She walked up the stairs to her box slowly, a large man following. My friends drank and smiled in the foreground. My eyes followed her and my chest tightened. Later, I fucked *him* and all I felt was despair. Would that I could have run away with her. Made her smile. 



It eats at you. Something black. A disease that makes you act, or not act.



I went to find the stars two nights ago. I went to find my friend, but she died too long ago. The sky cleared when I thought her name. The feeling, the chasm, spilled out and the sky had never been so black. Flat on my back, I felt bodiless. All that was, was stars. The past. The place I can never get back to. A darker flavour of euphoria tore through my veins and I wanted pain. 



Drugs take the edge off. I don't have any. 



6 years ago, my teacher said ""you've descended into nihilism. I tried to hang myself when I was your age. Don't tell anybody this"".


I look for somebody who feels like I do. They talk too much. They turn the song down before it climaxes. There is no desperation there.



If life is anybody's dream, it must be mine. It would just be nice to feel as though I share it with somebody else who is sentient. The world rushes in, calls me insane. I want to lie under the stars until I cry. I want to cut my arms to shreds because it's my body. I need this.

He failed his first year at university because he was very depressed and I can surmise that he always has been. He suffered drug problems as a teenager, then stopped smoking weed finally and adopted alcohol instead which was so much worse. Things spun out of control, he gradually lost interest and enjoyment in everything and was drunk all the time and it was terrible. He stopped playing drums which he used to love, stopped riding his bike, stopped doing uni work, didn't make any effort to find a job, alienated his family, lost most of his friends and nearly lost me.
Right now he's taking some time out of the education system, just got his first job, is drinking MUCH less (still slips up on occasion and gets drunk and depressed on his own) and I think taking it slowly is really helpful for him.
So my point is, I really get where you're coming from (having suffered depression myself too) and if you're really hating life atm that much perhaps you should just drop everything and take some time out to not do anything at all? Time and space to think and zero pressure might really do wonders for you if you can't find enjoyment or purpose in anything, if that makes sense.

I just returned from an inpatient program for a suicide attempt. I was so hesitant to go, but the advice I received fron people here was so encouraging. 

Getting hospitalized was the best thing I have ever done for myself.  In one week, I have made more progress than I would have ever thought imaginable.

Before I went I was a mess. I had zero self esteem,  I refused to eat, I just wanted to wither away and die. Nothing made me happy anymore. I felt alone in a room full of people. I either had to get busy living or get busy dying.

So, after all your kind words of encouragement, I voluntarily checked myself in. I won't lie, it was TERRIFYING at first.  That passes. Every staff member is there to make you feel safe and comfortable. If you treat them with respect they will return it in kind.

As long as you are one hundred percent honest, willing to do some work and introspection, and even the tiniest bit motivated to make a change, programs like this can really help. They will find medication that works for you and be there to listen 24 hours a day.

They taught me about self esteem and my inherent worth as a person. They helped me recognize and accept my positive qualities. I can finally see myself for the kind, creative, intelligent person I am. 

When I was discharged I walked outside and felt the sun on my face for the first time in five days. I cried tears of joy. The world is so beautiful. People are so beautiful.  And you, yes you reading this, are so beautiful. You are alive and you have worth. There are so many things to live for. And there is support if you will accept it. 

So to conclude my incoherent ramblings, I would like to return the favor and I am always here to listen if anybody needs someone to talk to.

By my best estimation, I have been quietly suicidal for about a decade now. It's more or less incontrovertible fact: I don't enjoy life, and nobody wants me around, so there is no real reason for me to be alive. It would be better for everyone - the only moral, unselfish thing, if you want to take it that far - for me not to be. Nothing has come of this, and I've never tried anything, but I literally cannot remember a time when I was not suicidal; that is a state of mind that more or less does not exist for me. I've never told anybody this. You can't, really, not if you prefer your life unruined. I've convinced, so far, my parents not to disown me, my university not to expel me, my roommate not to kick me out and a psychiatric ward not to commit me by saying I've never had thoughts of this: four times I've effectively saved my life by lying. 

The past year has been incredibly hard for me; everything I had has been taken away from me, one after one. ""At least I have my partner."" My partner broke up with me, and I haven't found anyone who wants to date me since. ""At least I still have my job."" I was laid off months ago, and I can't even get a job interview, despite having qualifications. ""At least I still have my friends."" I lost them all, more or less, or maybe they never really were my friends, but at any rate I don't have them anymore. ""At least I still have my savings."" Those are all gone now. ""At least I still have my health."" I'll find out in about a week whether I have cancer, which is a possibility. Next on this list, I suppose, is my family; at least one member's in poor health, another facing financial problems, so it's plausible at least. After that, I don't know what's even left.

Things have gotten worse lately. In the past week I've been taken to a psych ward for an evaluation after having a panic attack in public; gotten too drunk while going out with acquaintances I barely knew and yelled at them the entire way home, torching those friendships probably; seen three separate therapists; put off two assignments for graduate school due yesterday - which is something I'm doing right now even; the work is open in another window and I have to do it, have promised people I would get the work done yesterday, but I can't bring myself to for more than 30 seconds. At any given point I am either too lazy or too much in tears to. I am watching my life fall apart, and all I can do is watch.

Like the title said, I don't have any plan and I would never do anything concrete. I haven't for a decade; I'm too scared to. What nobody ever seems to take into consideration is that it might not work, and then your life is likely ruined even more: even if you don't manage to knock out half your life functions, you're facing lengthy hospitalization, a disrupted life, medical bills insurance won't cover and lifelong stigma; suicide attempts have never *improved* anyone's reputation, particularly if the person was unpopular in the first place. (Look at the Steubenville case. Someone can literally get gang-raped and receive death threats for it, even after a guilty conviction, because she wasn't liked by her classmates.) Even if it worked, it'd destroy my reputation; this sort of thing usually does unless you're on the level of Kurt Cobain or whomever, which I am not.

As I said, I don't have a plan and I don't even know what I'm trying to get out of this. The worst part is knowing that I can't tell anybody and that it won't get better.

When I was 22, I had flunked out of college (.27 GPA woo!) I was working a crappy tech support job that I hated (which was leading me towards hating technical work in general), my parents were angry with me because they thought I was lazy and not living up to my potential, I had no girlfriend, and few friends.  I was in a dark place, and I thought similarly to how you were thinking.  I understand how seductive that feel can be.

Now, it's 15 years later, and I'm a successful programmer with a loving wife and family, a home, a good job, and plenty of time and money to spend on hobbies.  I'm not saying I don't have my troubles, but it's a good life.  If I had given in at 22 I would not found the things I'm good at, not figured out how to turn my natural talents toward good ends, and not brought my life to this point.  That's the type of thing you are potentially giving up.

I know it's hard right now to see the way out of the darkness you're in.  I've been there.  But there are ways out, ways forward.  Start by listening to your psychologist and getting on an anti-depressant.  I resisted it for a long time, thinking it would change who I was, and the friend who finally convinced me to try it said that it was basically like this:  Depression is a bottomless pit.  Medication puts a bottom in that pit and gives you some handholds.  It won't do the work for you, but it gives you a fighting chance.

So give yourself a fighting chance.  Call your doctor and ask him to write you a prescription.

In advance, I apologize if my post happens to trigger anyone. Anyway, today I found out one of my closest friends, Dave, committed suicide on Saturday. I am in a state of shock, but have been crying almost non-stop. This just seems unreal to me. Dave was always there for me, during the best and worst times. He was one of the only individuals who helped me while I was struggling with depression, EDs, suicidal thoughts/attempts, among many other struggles. He was one of the first people I saw when I got out of the hospital when I had tried committing suicide. We did so much together, and were always there for each other, through thick and through thin. He was literally the big brother I never got to have. I can't help but blame myself. I was talking to him the day before it happened.

I like having a steady job. I like income I can rely on. I like being yelled at and motivated. I LOVE a challenge. 

Read that paragraph really carefully bro. Read that shit and find out if you like any of that (that's barely ANYTHING when you think about it). If you do, stick with it. You're a reservist by the sounds of it, (standard reservist contract is 6 years on 2 years off I believe). You are at the end of the tunnel dude.

Get a webcam for you AND your girlfriend skype. skype ALL THE FUCKING TIME. Any chance you get. Skype.

My entire life has just been one fail after another. As of recently my brother committed suicide and this has brought to light all the feelings about death I've had my entire life.

My girlfriend of 2 years now was in your exact same position, she had abusive parents and a father that constantly sexually abused her (not rape or any actual sexual activities) but would say it was his right as a father to make her do things. It destroyed her. When I met her she had no direction in life and was terrified. She began to trust me and I was very very patient with her, and from there on out we have been happily together for this past two years. Which leads me to my point. Be patient man, life is long. I know how badly you want things to happen for you right now, and I know how badly it must suck to have your girl leave you, but life will always surprise you in the end. You just need to be patient with it. Imagine life like a stream, and you can either choose to swim against it or swim with it. Your friends however are rare gifts, don't ever let them go.

The thing is, I think there is a symmetry in our relationship. Where as I would try to dissuade you from doing anything to harm yourself, I'm sure you would probably do the same for me.

113920,,True,Lulu_lovesmusik_,,,,"I'm so sorry you have been wounded from your past. Finding a dead body is serious stuff. I did not find my father, but a neighbor. It has me shaken too and it's been over a year. I can only just begin to imagine your pain or anxiety from that experience. Please tell me you have seen a counselor or someone who could help you cope with that experience. It's not too late to try talking to an expert. They know how to give you the tools to cope.

I've had some bad things from my past and sometimes it does make me feel like an immature child or something sometimes. It's like you would want to revert because you just can't move on sometimes.. I totally understand that.

So you haven't talked to many people for a long time, so how would you know no one would like you? If you really think you act like a 14 year old,.. there's plenty of man (and woman) children out there.. there's nothing wrong if you just have a quirky personality. I don't doubt theres some other socially awkward person out there who also may act like a kid sometimes. Heck.. that's starting to sound a little like me lol. I am so socially fearful and/or avoidant that I find it crippling to do something like go  to the post office to send a package if I have to talk to a human.. so I can understand avoiding being social.
It really helps to have an interest that you may find other people through. Even if you have some sort of random hobby or wondered how to do something.. there's bound to be a group in your town who does it and a sub reddit all about it with lots of users. What are your interests? Do you have any hobbies or things that you find interesting??

Also, I have seen people on this subreddit myself that have lost parents and who have found their dead parents before. I know people out there have been through the same thing and would understand completely.

I really don't want you to feel like it's so hopeless.. there's all sorts of people who care. Maybe if you just explained to your family your feelings.. they would understand. Maybe you are worried it will happen again with someone close.. I wouldn't blame you for trying to avoid that trauma again. But if you are thinking about family and you are really upset, it can only help to try, ya know? You might as well try to reach out because nothing will happen if you don't! I really believe they really would talk to you though. Try going on facebook and searching for somebody in your family as a first step.. you never know...

Anyway, I want you to know, I really understand your pain. I do. It would make sense that your physical pain is chronic because depression actually can create physical pain or make pain worse!!! Also, pain is exhausting, maybe you aren't a social butterfly because your exhausted from the physical pain and the pain from the depression! You can't be blamed for that. If you have a doctor, maybe you could tell them about this and see if they can help you. If you want medication, they might have some that could help with both pain and depression.

Anyhow, please don't give up. I really want you to try. I really do. Please let me know if you need anything or just want to talk about it.

Im 25 and have never even kissed a girl nor had a GF.  So don't think you are some big looser, its pretty common these days, especially with computers desocializing people.  

I can tell you, that you are not stupid.  Why would you even say such a thing?  Everybody has tasks they excel at and to some extent enjoy.  You just need to find them and do them.  Stop trying to fit into the mold you feel socirty wants.  Just do what feels right.  You dont need to be some hot shot making a ton of money to be happy.  The best job I ever had was working at circuit city.  

As for hating everything, why would you?  Are you to tell me you hate good food?  Do you hate women? would you not want to fuck one?  So you hate animals?  why not get a pet.  My cat is my best friend at times.  

I enjoy the simple things in life, like going for walks, seeing animals, eating and drinking good food.  I like watching movies and learning new things.  I really like mountain biking, its fun, good exercise and give you a nice thrill.  I really like walking through the woods at night and even better I love walking through major cities like ny at 4am when 90% of people are asleep.  

If you want a GF you need to work on you.  There are many girls who are never asked out, because they feel similarly to how you feel now.  They have it far worse then men.  If you see a girl you like just ask her out.  What is there really to loose?  You likely wont get a super hot GF, but better yet you may get one which understands you for you.

I been redditor for around 2years, but this is my first post
I will write little bit about myself here, so you guys can see what I'm going thru right now.
Since i started school, kids where always picking on me. My dad was working in Chicago, so we always went to visit him. I always had bunch of nice clothes, so kids in my school in Poland where always jealous of me. I always had couple good friends, so they were always helping me out. Once i turned 14-15 years old, me my mom and my younger brother moved to USA. Dollar value after 9-11 went so much down, that it wasn't worth anymore for my dad to work and send money to Poland, so around 2004 we moved to USA. I was really excited, new life, new friends. Elementary school was fun, even with zero language. Chicago is full of polish people, so I had no problem finding polish friends in school to help me out, and had fun with. Once I went to high school, I don't really know what happened, but I became really quiet. I had big anxiety attacks, I was always scared to talk to anyone, specially girls. By the end of high school, I started smoking lots of weed, and cigarettes so I can look cool, because that's what all cool kids did. When I finished high school, I went to college, I started parting a lot, lots of alcohol and cocaine. I had lots of friends, talked with lots of girls. I basically cured myself from anxiety and depression. During my collage, I got hooked on heroin, and for next six months, I was snoring it. I didn't even know it was heroin, the dude which hook me up told me it was some new drug blah blah... I quit college, I still had decent job, because I was working for private detective agency in down town Chicago, drove really nice car. After I found on it was heroin, well it was too late because I was hooked. I still managed keep the job somehow. Around when I was 21, I meet this girl Natalie, she was my first, after 3months she broke my heart. Well first month was hard, but I had heroin, and I was parting all the time, so I got over it. Couple months later I meet Brooke. I was still snorting heroin, lot of it, $60 a day easy. Well Brookes mom, never really cared about her kids, so one day she just kicked her out, so I let her move in to my parents house. My parents really loved that girl too, she was like theirs own kid to them. Now I was basically 24/7 with my girl friend, and there was no way, to hide my addiction, so my dumb ass got her hooked up... Even that we were addicted to heroin, we still loved each other, we got tattoos of ours name. I loved that girl so so much, she loved me too. Around August of 2012 my parents and hers found out about heroin, we went to rehab. After we got out, we were happy to be clean, we both where living in recovery houses. One day we end up relapsing, and we got kicked out from ours recovery houses. We were living in my car for like two weeks, till my car got police in pounded, because my friend had heroin on him. Well after that happen we didn't had a place to sleep, so we were sleeping on trains or airport. During this time we started to shoot up, and she end up overdosing couple times, every time I bring her back to. I started to had dreams, about her overdosing and dying, and every time I woke up in panic, but she was there by me. At this point we were so sick of this life, my parents let us move in under some conditions, her mom didn't want to know her. Around October of 2011, we both got good jobs, and everything was going great, till new year even of 2011. We went to a party and we both end up overdosing, but I woke up, she didn't. After that I tried killing myself, and I end up in hospital. Everyone was blaming me, and they are right, I killed her. I went on suboxone treatment, counseling. I cry every night, and ask whatever is up there why it was her ?, I'm the bad guy, it should be me. Her parents blaming me, I was even kick out from her wake, by them. I told myself, that this time I'm going to stay clean, so her death can mean something. 
Well last night I ended up relapsing, the stress, quilt, depression is killing me, nothing helps. I want to finish this life, I want to be with my love, I just don't wan to hurt my parents, I love them so much, but every day is a struggle. 

Some pics of hers and me.

Wife left me but still is friendly with me, we are still legally married and she never changed her address because of bills and me being on her health insurance.

Not a day goes by where I don't think about killing myself.  I ready know how and where.
I've started seeing a psychiatrist and am on mood stabilizing drugs and I KNOW it will take at least a month for them to start working, even with my suicidal thoughts he wants me to keep with this medicine for a month. 

I still am crazy hung up over my wife, she's in a bit of a mental mess too but she moved in with some mutual friends and has their support and company. 
I have this cold empty shell of a home we built together, every waking moment here is a reminder that my marriage failed.

I've been trying to only come to the house to sleep but I have 2 cats here that need love and attention that I am trying to give them. 

There's at least one night a week I get out of the house and go to a local hobby shop and play board/card games and just have fun... That's something I do look forward to.  It's also a great feeling for me that I'm the most attractive guy there by miles.  That's a great confidence boost, that's how I want to feel all the time. 

My performance at work is suffering, I try to keep my mind occupied but they have me doing shit work because of my performance and they do truly care and want me to succeed but sometimes important things fall through the cracks. 

Today was especially rough, I had a big project that was 3 hours away from my house.  Within 5 minutes of me getting there I find out my debit card info was stolen and my bank account was cleaned out.  I had 60 dollars in my savings.  Yes, sixty.
I am almost 30, most of my money is in a 401k though so I'm at least thankful for that. 
However, with all the mental and physical (oh yeah there's 2 spots on my body that are in pain 24/7, a spot behind my right testicle and a few inches northwest of it, if I roll on my side in the middle of the night I wake up in violent pain) stress I completely lost my mind at work, I called the bank and they said they can't do anything without a police report.
I have checks sent out that will bounce.

Long story short I left the important client, filed a police report, which I'll get in 5 to 7 business days and my boss is pissed that I left the client early to do this, I am probably getting written up because I lost my shit on the phone and screamed ""I WAS FUCK ING ROBBED, I DONT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS BUT IF I RUN OUT OF GAS THEN I'M REALLY FUCKED AND I WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO GET TO WORK""  not the best thing but the truth.  His response was ""file the police report later tonight the bank already canceled your debit card so what else can you do? ""  ahhhaha I don't know man, I don't have a level head right now

I came home, gave the cats food and water and grabbed my suicide kit....sat down...and cried until I fell asleep.  I put it away once I woke up.

It's hard to get motivated to get out of the house outside of my once a week.  I exercise at home, I'm in the process of giving away everything here to pretty much whomever will take it. 

It's a struggle and it sucks and I hate it, I hate the fact that I told my kitties they won't have me around much longer and if I didn't start sobbing uncontrollably I would have. 

I don't want to kill myself but I'm so very tired of fighting, I'm trying to take care of myself but coming home at night really kills me.
I need to get out, I need to find something to want to live for.  I feel like every hobby I pick up no longer interests me, even if I do go out and have fun I feel like all I'm doing is delaying my own death.  I'm dragging myself down, down, down.

Help would be appreciated.

So my dad is in a long state of depression, he has a rare brain disease or smth. I don't really know what is it, my relatives never really told me. it's been going for 2-3 years now. All he does is sit at home, watching TV. Sometimes he just stands still, frozen, probably lost in his thoughts. He rarely talks.

Today he asked me to buy him some medicals. **[It was this thing.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenazepam)** I went to the pharmacy, showed them the receipt, bought two packages. Came back home, handed it to him. When I asked him, why'd he ask me to buy them, he didn't answer at first. Then he asked me to keep it in secret from my granny (she's the one in charge of his medicals, treatment etc etc). After further interrogation he said, that she's giving him only half of the prescribed dose and that it's not enough for him to sleep comfortably. That is true, I checked, the prescribed dose is 1 tablet before sleep and granny stated that she gives him only half of a tablet. He swore to me that he won't use more that half a tablet from his own supply (to make it 1 tablet\day, as prescribed). Later this day granny came home and told me, that she got scared (I called her earlier, was confused about which medicals he actually asked to buy). When I asked why she got scared, she said that you can die from an overdose of it (read as: go to sleep, take tons of'em and never wake up). I didn't tell her that I actually bought him the thing.

Now I'm actually thinking about it. He can commit suicide any time he wants, right? My granny isn't always at home, most of the times its just me and him alone. I feel un-fucking-easy. Should I tell my granny? Even after he asked me to not tell her? I'm responsible for that shit. Fucking help me out.

**EDIT:**  So I just talked to my mom. Now she knows. She said that I should confess to grandma, since she knows better whats good for him. Now, I guess, if I won't talk to my grandma, my mom eventually will. Altho she stated a valid point: if my dad WILL actually OD, it will be blamed on me. I will totally feel like shit and I do have some relatives who will shitstorm on me fucking hard. I can already tell. Should I monitor the pills I've given to him? And, well, my mom will probably spill it out anyways. Probably even tomorrow, when I will be at school.

The worst part is that I know that writing this out and what I intend to do can't be healthy. It's probably just going to end up hurting me even more, but oh well. It's ridiculously sad, but I've come to accept that I'm going to be hurt by things, by people, and somehow telling myself that it's happened before and it's going to happen again makes me feel slightly ""average."" I would say ""better,"" but it doesn't quite catch the feelings I've had over the past year and a half. My ups aren't so up, because I know they'll eventually end. So, I'm not surprised when they do. My downs aren't that down, because I know I'll be ""happy"" again eventually. So, I'm pessimistic when I'm ""happy,"" which undoubtedly leads to sadness. I just can't help the ridiculous cycle of going through happy and sad with constant changes in my social circle or people I can rely on. People come and go. Others can accept that- why can't I?

Ramble. As you can tell by the username, I suffer from chronic loneliness. I've never really known a time when I wasn't lonely. The closest I've ever come to not feeling lonely was when I lived with my girlfriend for 8 months. Of course, like all things, that came to an end and I was thrown into a year and a half of the most ridiculous attempts at connecting with people- both dating and friends. Constantly being accepted and loved, then tossed to the side, forgotten the next. Maybe loved is the wrong word, but liked, cared about, held close so that you can hear each other's hearts beating. The closeness that you always long for with another human being- knowing that even if you aren't right next to them, they're wishing you were. It's odd how fickle we humans can be, taking something beautiful like that and turning it into a dramatic episode ending in tears or hurt feelings. After so many ups and downs, I'm numb... and I hate it.

I hate not really being happy when I'm happy, and I despise not being truly sad when I know I should be. I want to cry. I want to cry so bad. Sometimes I can manage a tear, and it's a stunning catharsis. When I'm happy, I want to do more than smile. I want to feel energized and stupid with *good feelings*. I want to shout at random strangers that life is great, even though I know far too much about the world to truly believe it. I want to be idealistic. I want to hope, but at the same time I want to be able to lose all of it. I'm stuck in this ridiculous limbo because I know this won't last, regardless of whether it's good or bad.

The only constant is this disgusting, stinging loneliness. When I'm alone in my apartment, I wish I could be watching a movie with someone. When I'm lying in my bed, I wish someone were cuddled up beside me or trying to push me over for more room. I never feel more alone though than when I'm in a giant group of people. At parties, at the park, going drinking with ""friends."" I notice how people take pictures but don't pull me in. I figure I should try to jump in anyway. I know they wouldn't mind- they probably think I want to be left alone. They couldn't be more wrong. I sit and think in public places hoping someone random will sit down and talk to me. I leave parties to get some fresh air, hoping someone will follow me. I'm so passive about it, because I have this ridiculous need to feel like someone notices, that someone *wants* to get to know me. A friend, a lover, a family member. In the end though, all I find is superficial relationships. My friends say they're busy, so of course we can't spend time together. My lovers, amibitious with big goals for their careers, so they must study. My family... we won't talk about my family. :(

So here I am, writing an anonymous post (surely discussing being lonely would just be more proof to my friends that I'm clingy, needy, and need to be discarded for their own good) to SW because I realized that I've been thinking for a few days how simple it would be to just stop being so needy. Ending my life would be absolutely neutral in the sense of the universe. To think it wouldn't be is egotistical to say the least. No one is close enough to me to be upset for more than two years, at most. Most everyone has distanced themselves on purpose, or I've pushed them away because I thought I couldn't trust them to be there for me the way I need someone to be there. But do I want to die? No, not at all. I just want to have the kind of support and friendship that a child has. I remember when I was young- everyday I went to school and saw the same people. Not everyone liked me, but those who did were friends. We talked everyday, all day at school. We often went over to each other's homes during weekdays. On weekends, we would always have sleepovers. It would be small groups so we could really talk and learn about one another. No big parties where no one really cares to remember the details of someone else's academic specialty. No chit chat. Real conversation. What happens to those children when they go to university... when they graduate and enter ""real life""? Why do we become so individualistic, so selfish, so self-absorbed. ""I don't have time to worry about others- I need to worry about me, number one."" Our jobs, our work. It's all so important that we see our ""friends"" once a week at best, maybe more like twice a month. How is that even decent? How can people stand that? What do these people have that I don't, that they can go without real human contact and interaction for so long. Who are these people who don't feel the longing for a lover when they go to sleep alone? I don't even know.

I don't care who you are, where you're from, or how you like your sandwiches. You're a person, and I want to talk to you. I want to have a meaningful connection with some person because we're people and can learn about one another. I want to tell you my life story, of my accomplishments, of my loves, of my sadnesses. I want to think of someone and actually be able to say I *know* that man or woman. I *know* them.

If you'd like to talk to me, about anything at all other than sports (lulz), you can add me on skype: **chronic.loneliness**

Since I don't expect anyone to talk for long or to talk more than once, I will let you know that I won't be surprised when we have a falling out or you never come online again. Happens all the time. My acceptance of this is probably a bad thing.

I'm 22, male, at an ivy-league university in my junior year, doing ""well"" (whatever the hell that means). I have borderline personality disorder and have been seeing a psychiatrist on and off since I was 14. I was abused sexually by a youth pastor who I'd confided in my ""guilt"" for being into sex at that age and not knowing how to handle the feelings. He not only did this to me but he told my parents what I had told him, and they freaked out (very conservative Christians) because, good lord, a 13 year old male was looking at a little softcore porn.

Needless to say this kind of fucked me up when it came to having anything normal relationship wise. I literally cannot have sex, which is kind of weird to most college girls one would date. And the ""Yeah, sorry, but see, I was molested, and ...."" isn't exactly the best kind of pillow-talk. 

Last year I had to withdraw from all my classes and take a leave of absence because I basically could not keep it together at all. I'm back now and am a week away from finishing the semester, and I'm doing pretty damn well all things considered, and I only have a year left after this.

Probably two years ago I got into D/s relationships, thinking that ""Oh, you know, maybe actively being submissive will help me get over my shit because it will be voluntary and all."" So I met a girl who was pretty nice but would treat me like shit. And I ""loved it"" but realized after a while it was probably not because it was voluntary on my part but because for some sick and fucked up reason, I found reliving that sort of thing _comforting_. I know how awful that sounds and I don't get it either but that's what it is. So eventually I was like, you know, I can't do this anymore. Now six months later...yeah, it's starting again. She's dating another guy and I'm basically a plaything/punching bag/servant.

It's as though I crave or seek out abuse to externally validate these internal shitty feelings and conceptions that I have about myself, so at least there will be some continuity between the way I'm treated and the way I feel, even if that continuity is by anyone's objective standards ""awful"" or ""bad"" or ""deranged."" Yet it makes me feel _better_. It's not as though it's causing the way I feel.

So, I mean, with all of that...here I am. Totally fucked in terms of having any sort of normal relationship, probably for the rest of my life. I'm on meds for the BPD but it's still a bit of a horrorshow from near-euphoric mania to terrible, mind-numbing, soul-crushing lows. Over spring break it was so bad that I didn't leave my apartment for ten days. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for, you know? I mean, it's not like this is some impulsive ""Oh damn, I'm gonna kill myself now"" decision. It's this thing that has just built up and built up for like the last eight years of my life. And I've tried to improve things, I've even tried like, drugs (not hard drugs, just recreational ones) and everything else I could imagine to shake me out of the way that I am, but nothing seems to work. I don't have any major ""goals"" for life. I'll be happy enough if I can get a job that pays for rent and food so that I can be financially independent.

But what then? Live for another 40 years with my cats and working to pay the rent? I mean...

I know there are answers like ""try hobbies"" or ""get exercise"" or ""get out and meet new people,"" but I've _tried_. I've really _tried_, you know? I've been trying all this time. It just hurts, and I break down crying at random things, I don't know how to handle myself, I have to pull myself off the floor and force myself to eat or study for my finals, or whatever.

I'm just so tired, you know? When I think about what I'm going to do with my life if I didn't feel this way, or if I had a billion dollars or something, I can pretty honestly say that I wouldn't be able to do anything differently than I'm doing now. Maybe I'd feel the same way in a different place, or be wearing nicer clothes, or typing on a nicer computer. And all that I can think of is the fact that I mean, a lot of people who are depressed _don't_ get better, and a lot of them _do_ kill themselves. And I mean, what if I'm just one of those people who isn't going to get better? And that I'm just either going to fight this all my life or that I'm just postponing the inevitable?

Why can't you get a job? Have to tried going into local stores and asking the managers for work? It can be a tough thing to do, but they mostly get applications online or over the phone, so they are much more likely to consider giving someone who comes to them in person a position.

&gt;I am going to hang myself.

Please do not do this.

So, have you started looking for work elsewhere? Get your resume out there. Find a job someplace that sucks less, and quit this one.

I'm sorry about your family history, but you have to realize that your mom did not necessarily mean what she said - clearly, she has problems of her own, and she just took them out on you. You have to realize that you are more awesome than you think you are. You have something to contribute to the world, whatever it may be.

You should consider therapy - it has helped a lot of people. It will help you work through what you consider to be problems, and find the root of your feelings about yourself and others. Medication can help, too, but that's to be considered after seeing a psychiatrist.

You don't need to worry too much about what do with changing - at least for now. Just get in touch with them and they will open up to you. It may seem to be worse at first, to feel that is, but Feeling is your way out, your way through, and your adventure.

You will find that feeling is what makes you alive... Smarter, sentient, and more powerful. All of the things that you have wanted about yourself. 

Wherever you are is what you need to begin with. Whatever you feel now.
Express that. Futility, hopelessness, self-hated, what have you. 

Don't worry about changing forms, changing looks etc. It may be important for you to feel it, and perhaps to go through doing it, and you will want to at some point - but it is NOT the focus primarily - It's about feeling as you are and finding how you WANT to look like - not what will possible give you the result.

(here's a hint, drawing, art and music all help you change forms -both created by yourself and by others - moving towards what really moves and motivates you can give you the looks you desire - art changes how you see the world. It makes everything more vibrant and real. Things LOOK and FEEL different. Just like differentiating a taste when it comes to food. More experiences yield a different appreciation of things)

The most healthy, radiant, attractive people - are people who are free to be themselves. 

Feeling your worst will give you the strength to be your best - and it will have all the meaning in the world.

It's Healing, and it, above all, will help you see that you are not alone... Your own experience of Healing is the greatest thing you can do for the whole world.

Good luck. :)

But I just can't...
Everyday I'm thinking about killing myself and ending all this misery. But I'm just to scared of death and never seeing the people that I love again (which are actually not that many). And you never know what happens tomorrow...But really I just don't believe in all of this anymore. Everyday is a disappointment. 
So I might have to give you some background information:
All I ever wanted was a girlfriend. Somebody I could love every single day and make her happy. Someone I could spend my time with. Someone I could talk to and well...make love to. And I had this one girl. She was the most beautiful and amazing person I know in my life. But I made some mistakes that I can never forgive myself even though she says she forgave me a while ago. 
About 4 months ago when the summer holidays began she travelled to Greece for 2 weeks. I thought everything would be alright again when she comes back and we can forget all what happened. But the day she came back...she told me she cheated on me. 30 minutes later she broke up with me (per icq...). I drove over to her because I didn't want it to be over or true. So the next few weeks she made out with me, with the guy she betrayed me with and another guy she didn't even know. She did all of that because she wanted to forget me and those guys reminded her of me, whatever that means...
In the fifth week after she came back from Italy (holiday with her family) she told me she wanted to see me and talk about something because she had time to think about everything. That Monday we made out again and she told me that deep inside her she still loved me. I was unbelievably happy. That day I also saw her Facebook password and thought maybe I should jot it down for 'investigations'. So that week on Thursday I knew something was wrong because she didn't respond to me the whole day. I wanted to see her so badly that night so I went with my bike. I was almost there when she finally responded. I told her were I was (sitting on the street, crying) and that I worried about her. She said I just should go home and try to sleep. 
The next day I received a message from her in which she wrote that 'we'll never get back together and that she doesn't love me anymore. That she had to end all contact with me and that she thinks its better than all the back and forth between us'. I was furious. Angry. Sad. I smashed the glass of our stove and ended up with almost losing my right hand. My mother and father brought me to the hospital. I screamed the whole way to it. There the doctors took my accident as a suicide attempt. 
When I came back home I logged into her Facebook account...I found out that on Thursday she made out with the second guy and that she plans on making out with the first guy from Greece on Saturday. So on Saturday morning I went to her and wanted to say goodbye. I wanted to end my miserable life. I brought our stuff with me because I didn't want it anymore. But I couldn't talk to her because her father lied to me (probably because she told him to). Then the last week began. I just wanted to say goodbye to her because I wanted to commit suicide on Sunday.
But then I think on Wednesday she contacted me again. I told her that I know everything what happened and that she'll never see me again. Suddenly she started with what is with all the things we had planned out (mostly 12th December. We talked about engagement on this day because it'd be the 12.12.2012). I said that those WERE our plans and she answered that they ARE ours. I was in shock. She still loved me and she told me how much she misses me and all that. So we met on Friday and Saturday and were back together. It was like in a dream how all of it happened. 
So the next few weeks I tried everything that it'll work again. I skipped school. Waited 2 hours alone in the cold night so we could see us. I went to the train station during school so I could see her for 5 minutes...
I believed that we could be happy together again. 
But then one weekend were she was supposed to stay at our house she didn't come and told me she felt really sick. She lied to me saying that she'll come the next day and that she had to do a presentation for school. 
After that weekend she broke up with me again. She told lies about me to her mother that I forced her into sex and that I had hit her. 
So after that my life went downhill. I neglected everything. 
My life is complete shit. I don't care for anything at all. I just want to be dead. 
She is 'in love' with another guy. But we kissed again on Friday last week. She is just a little bitch. 
Right now I have planned on committing suicide on the 14th of December. I need to watch The Hobbit on the 13th. 
And yes I have friends, I even have a female best friend. They are there for me. But I just don't want to keep going on. 
Well...that's it. 
And sorry for my bad English. I'm from Germany. 
Edit: And right now I have realized that I'm in love with my best friend. She has been there for me almost all the time and helped me through the bad times. And I know (seriously, I know it) we'll never be together. Because you know, woman don't want to lose friendship and shit...
Edit 2: I think about ending it all the time. I'll just lay on the rails eventually. But I want to watch The Hobbit first...and I don't know if I can hold on that much longer...

I didn't realize that after 17 years of people treating my like shit and being unable to stand up for myself due to company policies, that I had developed a mental illness. I spent an entire year only leaving my home to buy food and other basic supplies. When I try to interact with people, I get this overwhelming feeling of hate and depression.

I've recently decided to face my demons and confront my beliefs but this time hopefully transcend them. Basically I'm terribly afraid that I'll rationally commit suicide because of my fear of death and the absurdity of life. 

I believe that because of death and the absurdity of life, our lives become meaningless. To explain, we live for a certain amount of time on this planet and then die. When we are gone we lose everything such as our memories and experiences that we gained in our lives up to that point and it disappears except for the things we left behind in the world. In this sense life is meaningless because we will always end up losing this game, it doesn't matter whether or not I died of old age or offed myself now, so why not off ourselves to save us the trouble? 

I find this to be very disturbing and I really do hope there is some sort of answer to this conundrum, but I realize that as of yet there is nothing. And it gives me this urge that I should just quit life since in the end we'll always just lose it all, because when we are gone we wouldn't have known we were even here in the first place, so what's the point?

We were together for years until financial problems caused us to separate briefly, after which I moved to a new city to be with her and asked for her hand in marriage.  She accepted but gave the ring back soon after. That was about six months ago. At the moment, I'm unemployed, terminated from my last job by a misunderstanding.  I have few friends, most don't live near me and the ones who don't I rarely speak to.  My family is just my mother, who lives in another city as well.  We don't relate terribly well.  I have a woman in my life who lives with me who is very special to me, but I fear that I can't be what she needs me to be. I hate this city and there's nothing for me here except for her.  I spent most of my time alone, at home, trying to find work as my funds dwindle.

I get more anxious with every day, I find it very hard to use the phone, I procrastinate and avoid situations that cause anxiety and so often I do nothing at all, having had enough of the want-to-scream feeling that anxiety brings.

If anyone looks too hard, we'll find that the only definite answer to your questions seems to be that life is meaningless. I accept nihilism as a school of thought, but don't buy into it, because we can't go anywhere from the conclusion. If it were the best way to think, our species would have died out centuries ago. Instead, **passion** drives us - whether it be consciously or not - to get what we can out of life and to pursue fulfilling experiences.

Consider this: *you* have the ability to give meaning to your life. Rather than to ask why you are here, think about why you enjoy being here. Many of us tend to overlook the things in our lives that give us satisfaction, because we live in societies that prescribe what we should value: money, power, material stuff, and good reputation. For many people, these values are incongruent with their mind, person, spirit, soul, etc. That doesn't mean the person is wrong or errant, but simply different.

I think this is an existential problem that none of will ever solve. To *be* anything suggests that we've reached an end state. Instead, I find it motivating to view us as *becoming*.

Despite how long I'd been depressed, I also lied a lot to keep people around me from knowing. So I have no doubt that it completely blindsided her. She has her own issues with depression and anxiety and day-to-day things seem to break her down; I was terrified that this would cripple her. I was wrong.

Parents, and mothers in particular, are capable of unimaginable strength, both physical and emotional, when their children are in danger. She'd rather you tell her now and worry about it than find out after you've completed suicide. I guarantee that.

And I understand not wanting your friends/loved ones to know. I kept it hidden, and I still do. That's why a therapist has been such a big help, she cares about me but not SO much that it detracts from her ability to stay rational. The few times I had confided in friends regarding my suicidal feelings, I got mixed results and all were more harm than help given my mental state. It's just tough for people who aren't suicidal to understand the how our brains warp things, and it's even tougher when they're emotionally involved.

What you say to your therapist is confidential unless they have reason to suspect that you're in immediate danger to yourself or others. Tell him/her that you've been thinking about it a lot, but that you aren't in immediate danger and nobody has to know.

I'll share, I'm almost 50 and by not having my masters I'm really, really limited. There are jobs I can do, but without that piece of paper I'm not even considered. My SO and I are really encouraging our sons to get masters while in their 20s because it becomes very hard to when older.

I know that sounds pedantic, but it's what we experience.

Don't worry about the future. I mean that. Just do what you need to do to get through each semester. There's an odd pattern or logic to the universe and that is that when we show up for life, it shows up for us. It's not wishful thinking, or positive thinking, or new age, or religious. My own little take is that when we act with integrity and are kind life gives it back to us, and wheels turn that we never knew were there. 

I remember graduating without a job, and I went with some friends to another state. I had no idea what would happen, what I'd do. I thought I'd end up in some pizza shop or something. I applied for a job with an engineering firm (my degree is in geology with heavy math) out of the blue, and within 6 weeks of graduating I got a job. I didn't know up from down in it to start, but learned quickly. 

Made tons of money, but had no time off. After a while I became a high school math teacher so now I don't have much money, but do have time off. 

I'd really recommend teaching. With a masters you can teach in any community college (I can't, but know my stuff. It's the damn piece of paper).

I never reached that mountain road, I turned around after a bit and went back to my town. I got back home an hour later and went to bed.

119456,,True,dayresidue,,,,"I am so sorry to hear about your Dad. Actually about all of it, but your Dad especially. I think it is quite amazing to read everything you have done. You sound like one of the strongest people I have ever encountered. I know how it feels, although not nearly to the extent as you discuss here. People probably change the subject when you start talking about things that are difficult because they know how strong you are and either don't want to shatter their ideal of you, or just want to talk about themselves because they are so used to you listening to them.  This is something I deal with on a regular basis from my friends/family and it is very frustrating. 

I have no idea what the circumstances were surrounding the rape, but if people are blaming you then they don't deserve your attention, because it's just not constructive no matter what actually happened. If it is really that destructive for you, you should get counseling.  Your Dad knows now, so worrying about him passing away thinking you didn't want to hug him because of something he did is over. Don't worry about that anymore.

Did you get another cat to help you cope with the loss of the last one?  Or a dog? I know your cat can't be replaced, but getting another animal to hep you cope with his loss isn't sacrilegious. He would understand.

Have you talk to your Fiance? Does he understand what you're going through? I am ignorant of the circumstances leading to his job loss, but I am sure if he just knew how stressful this was to you, he would try very hard to start working again in order to help take some of this weight off of you.",,0.0,,2013-07-13 14:42:02,,,0,False,,,,0,,cb1t605,,,,,t3_1i7azs,,,t1_cb1t605,,,,t3_1i7azs,,,,,,,,1430482355.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

After two years of depression I had a major manic breakdown after finally getting my life together to the point where I considered myself happy. This resulted in me getting locked up for two weeks and consequently I lost everything, car/job/home/band/a few friends, all my money...
I had to move to new mexico and spent a year depressed just working up the motivation to find another job because my disability never went through.
Finally moved back to my hometown a year ago, thought I was doing great, I had accomplished all of my desperate goals.  I found my own place (shared) again, a great band, I'm working, have great sex on the regular... SO WHY DO I WANT TO DIE? Or at least cease to exist.

These thoughts have been cropping up more frequently since december, when I got hurt at work. I'm sure it has a lot to do with it since now my back is sore all the time and most of my days off, like today, I cant get out of bed because my body is telling me it needs rest. I'm exhausted. The doctor wont continue my medication despite the fact it improves my quality of life greatly (it's not opiates, then I would REALLY want to die) I've taken to smoking pot at work, one of my major no-no's at a corporate job but it makes life bearable.

I know full well that my life is a sham. I'm working full time for a company that only gives fucks about money. I was told last night that there is a customer who regularly harasses our female employees, but when concerns reached the manager he replied ""He's a valuable customer."" FUCK THAT! How can I pretend to support that? This is my life now. I'm about ready to throw everything out and be homeless because then I would only be living for myself not being exploited for profit. (Also while trying to ignore even worse human injustices daily, this is big because I get way down about largely being part of the problem rather than the solution.)

I'm playing in a band with a bunch of kids because I still thought I could be a rockstar. Kinda wasted the last year on that... all my free time. They are talented kids though.
Long story short I should have no complaints but I've been spending time today trying to figure  out again how to off myself.

If the school and people around you do not seem to take you seriously, for whatever reason, there are national help line that might be able to.  You seem to need some psychological counseling, it's very important that you obtain one.
     With that said, take another step back, don't aggravate the situation any more by hurting yourself or anyone else, physically or emotionally.
     For the problem of stalking, the police will do what is necessary to stop it, document everything that you feel is threatening that he does.  Whether it's a phone call, text, threats through a peer, etc.
     Like most situations, it seems your problem is compounded by other issues that worsen the problems you have, for that you need family counseling, most family do not want to even hear someone mention that there is so much dysfunction that therapy is necessary, and some might even agree with your cause and help you to obtain it.

That was 7 years ago; I'm 20 now, and though I still deal with depression every day, at least I feel like my life is worth living. 

I don't know you, and obviously it's impossible for me to know exactly how you're feeling right now; just know that I've been in the same kind of bad place you're in right now, and so have a lot of others, so you're not alone. 

You probably don't really feel like a kid, but you still are one in some ways. You're still developing emotionally and mentally, and that'll last well into your twenties. Your depression might just be a mental kink that will work itself out with time, or it could be something you'll have to cope with for most of your life. Only time will tell. The smartest thing you can do right now is to develop a plan of attack and turn self-improvement into your top priority. That option would prove to be a hell of a lot more rewarding than ending your own life before it has even really begun. 

Some well-meaning but ignorant adults might write this off as hormone-fueled teenage angst or some shit like that, but that's clearly not what's going on here.

I've been using the mantra ""when nothing you do matters, then all that matters is what you do,"" to keep going, because I'm sliding into a depression. I've already had a few days where getting out of bed was a problem and I keep fighting to not let it fully suck me under. I just want to give up and give in and let it take over, because nothing matters.

The worst point was yesterday when I talked to my father. I had this belief, fueled by societies ""happy ending"" lie, that one day I would finally overcome my illness, or even turn it into a superpower like Amy Mullins did with her legs. I believed that I would have friends and a community, and a house and a fulfilling career (or at least financial security), and after talking to my dad last night, I realized that I'm doomed to this life as long as I live.

He said he suffered the same things I did, he never had friends, he struggled with school and work and being organized. What was worse was that where I fully invested myself in holding to values of honesty and trust, which screwed me over repeatedly, because people took advantage, and I was punished and paid for sticking to the truth, he bullshitted his way through everything and was rewarded for it.

He's in his 70s now and accepts that he's living alone, that he has no friends, that his body is falling apart slowly, he enjoys being alone and writing books, he struggles to make ends meet, and it is what it is.

That is precisely the life I didn't want, that I have fought against for so long. And now I realized this fight has been for nothing, and that I'm doomed to this miserable existence no matter what I do, I'll be like him.

I'm waiting for him to die, the last decade has been the hardest for me, and since this is essentially the rest of my life is going to be like, I will wait a few years for him to pass on so I don't hurt him, and I will take my life to end my suffering. I wish I could do it now, and I hate myself for sacrificing and enduring pain for others, the choice that I have paid a price for again and again.

I also am in pain from all the men I've dated who lied and used me. The last one deliberately hurt and destroyed me and now is happy with his life while I suffer. I want to see him pay. I want to take away everything dear to him and make him suffer the pain he caused me.

Getting into recovery, whatever that might mean to you, was instrumental I think in helping me keep going. Addiction is a killer, and I don't care what the addiction is. If it's internet or video games or sex or booze, it all kills. Sometimes it's in really obvious ways like car wrecks, and sometimes it's in really slow subtle ones that just kill you on the inside. 

Maybe you'll find, like me, that all the things you were running to to save you were actually the things that were going to kill you, and the things you were running from are actually going to save you.

21710,,True,1-Ceth,,,,"I'd never been one for friends either, and empathy is certainly not a strong point. In seventh grade I had few friends and had issues staying in school. In eighth grade I found a new group through one of the few friends I had, and they remained my friends until about tenth grade, when we drifted apart (largely because I felt their maturity levels and general intelligence were far below my own, I didn't feel like I could have a conversation with any of them where they could actually understand what I was trying to say to them). The only real reason I hung out with them was so I'd have someone to play Xbox with. 

In tenth grade, as I was distancing myself from this group I met a girl. She was incredible. Pretty, dedicated, honest, and most importantly, welcoming. After months I finally managed the courage to ask her out. She said no, and while I was disappointed at the time, it was probably for the better. She asked me to start hanging out with her and some of her friends. Being the inspiring person she was, her friends quickly welcomed me to the group. After this, I quickly made friends as I was introduced to more people and became better at coming out of my shell. 

Today I have a network of friends who I care about more than anything, and I continue to make friends as I go. I even have had a couple of SOs. 

Things will get better. You'll find your place eventually. Become friends with people who respect you. If anything, try to become friends with one person. I guarantee that you'll see your group of friends start to grow at an almost exponential rate.

Hold on tight to your dream

Hold on tight to your dream

When you see your ship go sailing

When you feel your heart is breaking

Hold tight to your dream.


Its a long time to be gone

Time just rolls on and on

When you need a shoulder to cry on

When you get so sick of trying

Just hold tight to your dream

Chorus:

When you get so down that you can't get up

And you want so much but you're all out of luck

When you're so downhearted and misunderstood

Quand tu vois ton bateau partir

Quand tu sents -- ton coeur se briser

When you hear that cold wind calling

19354,,True,[deleted],,,,"About grad school, my best recommendation is to talk with one of the professors that you're closest to and let him know how you have a passion for philosophy but don't think your grades would get you in, but you want to do it with all your heart, etc.

You'd be amazed at how much pull some professors have with grad schools. Sure, the schools will look at grades and test scores but there are also various ways to squeeze in other students, for example starting a semester late or early so the student's stats don't factor into the average admissions profile.

Anyway, talking to a prof and getting him/her on your side is the best advice I have on that one. 

Don't worry so much about grades- my grades in high school were positively awful. Once I got into college no one cared about my high school grades. My grades in college were just average. Once I got into grad school no one cared about my college grades.

Also you may think you want to become a philosophy professor but life has many twists and turns and you never know where you may be led.

&gt;I have been miserable and unable to be happy my whole life, what reason have I to think that will ever change?

The reason you cry easily and the reason you feel the way you do is because your bad experiences are relatively recent and you're still confronted by daily situations which remind you of that, not necessarily consciously.

I went through a lot of stuff when I was a kid and remember feeling the way you do now. Over time it gets better because you go through new experiences and your childhood becomes more of a distant memory- it starts to feel less emotional, less involved- more like the memory of something you read in the past not something you lived through. That's the best way I can explain it.

Life does get better from here on out. Life in childhood and academia has one major downside- you don't *really* make your own choices. Ok maybe what college you go to (so long as you are accepted, so long as you can afford it, so long as your parents agree, etc) and what major you study (again, with lots of constraints), but in general you are following a path- it's like driving those little cars at an amusement park, you only have the illusion of steering.

But when you graduate and go into the working world you start to realize that you have the freedom to do what you want, be who you want, whenever you want.

So you are full of regret, then it's time to change. You said you know you can be a better husband and father, then prove it! You have to show her and more importantly yourself that you can. Prove it to her that she is worth changing for, even if it means you have to wait patiently to earn her trust back. She may not let you be very 'husbandly' to her right now, but you guys have a kid. Show her that you are changing, through your/her kid. It may take a while, but if she's the one that you'll go to the moon and back for then it's worth the wait and effort. 

I can see your still grieving, that's fine. You've lost something that's valuable in your life, so grief away. Go on and scream it all out, or break some dishes they're replaceable, but remember to come back to yourself! Don't over do it tho, because she still loves you, which is why she decided to take a 'break' from the marriage instead of the worst alternative. She wants to give you another chance, but she knows she will only get hurt if she rushes it. Just like how you know not to push yourself on her. 

She is giving you space, because that's all she can do right now. I'm sure deep in your heart you know that she is waiting for you, so don't take too long. Make sure you come back from all the grief and anger you feel now, and start over. Come back and prove to her and yourself that you CAN be a BETTER man. Write it down and send it to her, hold her hand and look her in the eye and swear to it! That way you will feel obligated to achieve it!

There's nothing wrong with you. We all make mistakes, but it's how we bounce back that matters the most! We may feel lost when we are the victim of the situation, because we are overwhelmed by the fact that it is occurring to us. But do not lose heart, it is the way of life. We fall, we get back up. By reaching out on the Internet, you are already showing yourself that you want to be that better man you know you can be. We can give non-bias advices because we are not involved, but it is you who has the power to turn the life of you, your wife and kid around.

Be the better man, **we** know you can be! Don't give in!

Take good care of yourself! xx

I can't guarantee you'll live long enough to find out. Natural causes and acts of god and whatnot. But I'd be willing to be twenty caps that if you endure, struggle, and continue to choose living... you will eventually figure that answer out yourself.

What I can tell you is this... those feelings your feeling? Probably a lot more perfectly normal than you realize. I know I've felt them, and a lot of other people felt them as well. Some people feel those feelings and let them pass appropriately. Some people, like myself, give into those destructive urges and off ourselves. I'm lucky, I've survived my own suicides. Not everyone else is.

Suicide seems logical, and that's true. Especially when you believe in an afterlife. In fact, until it was outlawed, there was once a rash of Christian monks who decided to off themselves  get to heaven sooner. But combat logic with logic and see how you feel about this: The more time we spend on this Earth, the more we think and feel. And though not all those thoughts are pleasant, and not all those feelings are good, it is still nonetheless part of a beautiful unique human experience. And the sooner we die, should we off ourselves, the less we experience.

Natalia. Not her real name, but similar. Her short black hair. Her olive skin. The way she quietly sang to herself. She has the most beautiful voice of anyone I've ever heard. Her smile. How soft her lips are. How good she gives hugs. How everyone said we were so cute together. I'm 14. She's 16. I bet that made your interest drop. But hear me out. Last year in 8th grade we signed up for the classes we wanted next year. When electives came up I saw ""Technical Theatre"", with a short description of what it was. So I signed up, seemed pretty cool. I got the class. Beginning of freshman year. Usual freshman anxiety. I saw her. Thought nothing of her. She looks boyish, I thought. She's almost the same size as me, and I'm pretty big. Flash forward. November 2014. We're almost done with a rehearsal, and there's nothing to do. Me and Natalia happen to sit next to each other and we quietly converse backstage for an hour or so. Then we became friends. A week or so later, I got over my anxiety and asked her out. She said yes. ""You guys are so cute!"" Everyone said. We spent all the time we could together. I fell in love with her. And she fell in love with me. November 12th, 2014 was the day we began going out. March 11th, 2015. I got a text from her on the bus home saying ""I'm done with your shit. Goodbye."" You can guess what ran through my head. I reply ""Are you serious?"" ""Yes. Bye."" A few minutes later I get another text saying ""Ana just gave me my phone and said sorry and to text you, what happened?"" ""YOU FUCKING BROKE UP WITH ME."" She said that Ana wanted to look at her pictures. Apparently not. Still angry about what had just occurred, I decided not to believe her. Everything I didn't like about her came flooding into my mind. How she couldn't help but tell her friends about what happened with us behind closed doors. How she was always reluctant to do anything. How she was always so damn overprotective of her phone. If I ever grabbed it and teased her with it she freaked out. All these things made me dump her right then and there through text like the little bitch I am. Every day since has been horrible. I already had depression. Diagnosed and everything. Thinking about suicide less intensely and almost constantly is much worse than thinking about it more intensely and less often. I wanted to ask her to take me back. But I knew it wouldn't be the same. I know how this goes. After something like this happens, when two teenagers get back together it doesn't last long. Never does. I left her when she needed me most. Her family was treating her terrible. She was getting threats from her relatives in Japan (we're American). We had started making decisions together that would affect us in life. We had often talked about how we wanted to get married and everything. Typical teenage relationship stuff. We loved each other so much. But our love was so much more. It felt like we had been together so much longer than 4 months. It felt like 4 decades. When we were together, time stopped. We became the only two people in the world. Nothing else mattered but us. We just tried to be as close to each other as possible and enjoy staring into the other's eyes. I thought we would grow old and die together. She did too. And my fucking retarded self ended it. We were filling the pages of a book and I grabbed it and burned it. We were such a big part of each other's lives. It's all gone now. All of it. Nothing else matters now. **A life without her is not a life worth living anymore.** Of course, I can't just go into the kitchen, grab a knife and slit my wrists. I'm too much of a pussy for that.

13931,,True,[deleted],,,,"Other people have posted good advice, so I'll just comment on a couple of things.  You sound very hesitant to consider yourself depressed or bi-polar.  While of course you can't diagnose yourself, I think it's also important not to hastily conclude it's not mental illness if you are experiencing symptoms of such.  Wanting to kill yourself is always serious and bad, and it's probably in your interest to talk to someone about it (e.g. your general practitioner, school counselor, someone who you trust who can objectively consider things and make recommendations).  It could just be that you're going through a difficult part of your life, but if it isn't then it's better to treat it sooner rather than later (I'm speaking from personal experience).  I hope I don't sound like I'm talking down to you or trying to scare you.  I'm just trying to say what I would want to tell a younger me.

I also want to really stress that there's nothing wrong with feeling depressed or bi-polar or anything like that.  It's not your fault in anyway and it's nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed of.  It doesn't matter what external events caused it if anything.  Your pain and suffering warrants just as much compassion as anyone else's.

Oh, how any parents would: by mocking me, making fun of the way I look (calling me fat, insulting what I eat or what I wear,) treating me like shit, and telling me (over and over again) that as soon as I'm 18 (coming up in June for those that don't know-not a long while away) they are kicking me out (may I mention that the most basic thing I as a home schooled high schooler need, the new GED equivalency test, they still have not purchased and even use the test as a threat, so they certainly have done their best to make my adulthood when they do kick me out swell!) And to add on to that last one, my joyous mother has even made it clear that if my grandmother helps me in any way when they kick me out that they will cut contact with her completely. 

I know raising me can't of been easy and recently I haven't been very fun to be around, but treating your overtly suicidal daughter like this fucking hurts. It's like, I don't even know what I'm going to do at this point, but what's the point? If the people who are suppose to be the most supportive can't even stay pleasant with me for more than three days (the record I've kept track,) why bother?

Oh, and if I don't respond to you via text/facebook/email, it's probably because I see myself in a huge amount of trouble for this post not because I'm ignoring you.

EDIT: I thought about this for a second, and much less of the blame should be going to my father than I made this sound but I don't want to completely rewrite this.""

So, that gives you the general feel. To be honest I have posted here before and it helped but this time I can't see how anything could. I'm a mess, a huge fucking mess. I have no future, both I and my parents have seen to that, my mother has recently gone from sporadically treating my like dog shit, to constantly. Just this morning she told me that she is kicking me out as as soon as I'm 18, is not going to get me the GED until I ""earn it,"" and repeatedly called me a stupid bitch. Why? Because when she made a snotty comment about me sleeping during the day after she had been just terrible to me for days I said, and I quote, I wonder why I don't want to be awake during the day. True, I shouldn't have said it but I don't see how that merits the punishment!!! 

In truth, I gave up weeks ago. I had been trying to teach myself since my parents don't actually homeschool me nor my siblings, but I gave up on that. Then I gave up on trying to teach my siblings when my already small amount of resources dwindled. Then I stopped doing any chores at all two weeks ago as a pathetic attempt to force them to treat me better, or at the very least get me the GED! Then I gave up on trying to interact with my family when every time I did I got shit on. Then I just gave up on me: I hardly have the will to bath or change clothes. So at this point I'm having a hard time seeing why i shouldn't just give up on life.

My life is never going to be easy, or even close to normal anyways. I'm  gay, with aspergers, and terribly poor. I'm sick constantly and don't know why; my mother says I'm a hypochondriac. I have no people skills and the only way I feel comfortably dressing outs me almost instantly. Plus, now I'm going to get in trouble for posting my little suicide note publicly.

In short, despite the awful crap that's been hurled at you lately, you *can* get through this. Cliched, but true.

Not that I'm advocating it, but if things really don't improve over time (months+), or shit returns...well, the option exists then. To do it now without having got help would be  tragic :( Medication and therapy both really can - and usually *do* - help.

is it possible you are being too hard on yourself? the things that are important aren't your (possibly imagined?) faults, they are your strengths. Instead of saying ""I am alone, this is a bad thing,"" say ""I am alone, but this means I'm self-sufficient."" 

&gt;I remember being told by all my friends that he was abusive and it is making everything worse for me.

Usually if your friends tell you this, it means they're looking out for you. Many abusive individuals keep control of a relationship based on the pretense that the other person would be ""nothing without them,"" and oftentimes this pretense sticks even after the relationship is ended.

And speaking of friends, where are these friends now? Try to reach out to them, perhaps? If a personal friend were to reach out about depression/suicide I would dedicate as much time as necessary to helping them through whatever could be bothering them; I'm pretty sure that's one of the things that defines someone as a ""friend"" opposed to just an ""acquaintance."" I'm confident that your friends don't *want* you feeling depressed.

You are not alone. There's nothing wrong with wanting ""a friend or even someone to love,"" but these things take patience, they don't appear immediately as we want them^(unlike cat gifs)

The reddit communities of /r/SuicideWatch and /r/depression are generally caring, supportive people, and many of them have similar experiences; never be afraid to reach out if you need help.

51425,,True,CakeVSPie,,,,"whoa whoa whoa. hold your horses hombre, I got a couple of things to say:

1) you're twenty-two, in school, and yet accomplished nothing? You said you took a year off, and now this year you enrolled again. Do you know how many people wouldn't go back to school after taking a year off? If you still go the route of being an undergrad for 7-8 years, do you realize you'll have a degree?! I think that's an accomplishment.  Also, sociology can help a LOT in fields like marketing/sales/advertising (my field! I was a psych major).  

2) I'm not going to sugarcoat the friends situation.  Making friends in your 20s is hard (I'm a 23 year old girl and struggle making friends, due to me being extremely uncomfortable in trying new things).  I will tell you what helps is thinking to yourself in a social situation, ""I have the same right to be here as this person""  No one is perfect, you may see a beautiful girl and don't realize that she has mental issues, or see a guy and don't realize that he struggles with ocd.  Another thing that helps me is....reddit! It's easier, for me at least, to socialize with others through a computer.  In addition, you can join a subreddit of things going on in your city, become friendly with people in that subreddit, and possibly go on an outing later. 

3) As someone with a quick temper, it's hard, very hard, to control my emotions sometimes.  I feel like I need to physically do something to get the aggression out (much like you with breaking things).  I have to check myself (because, if not, i would wreck myself) by saying ""is it worth it?"" more often, it's not.

I never been good at taking all my medication and I only ever used to take tablets because they were easy but I stopped completely when I realized that after a visit to the doctor to a prescription I decided I'd be brave and tell him of my depression but it was a huge mistake on my part because I think he disregarded it just to give me the prescription and send me on my way after telling me that the medication on the prescription was worth thousands of euro.

Going back to taking to him about my depression he asked if I wanted to cause harm to myself and replied that I just wanted to fall asleep and die without pain or disappear without anyone knowing or causes a fuss about it and then asked if I felt like drugs would help(assuming anti-depressants) I said that I feel as though I'm at a stage where I can come out of it naturally if I was given some sort of hope or meaning. I asked him if there was any supports available to help went paying for rent(just for a few months to see if I would change my attitude) if I moved to a more urban area closer to the hospital and would be easier to go out and try to get to know people or find some part time job but I think he took it as that I made up the whole thing to try and milk it. Thinking back its funny having a system that will pay for medication that costs thousands per month but when you suggest that moving closer to a hospital for health concerns and be more convenient at a fraction of the price its a different story.

Here is the rest of my suggestion: You are 15. Take a deep breath and realize that most kids feel quite a bit like you. You need something to occupy your time and it simply cannot be f5ing 4chan/reddit/fark/spankwire for new updates. You need to understand that out there, at school, are probably dozens/hundreds of kids that want to hang out too. Find a table with some kids that look a little lonely and sit down. I met my best friend that way and now we hang out at least twice a week even at 26 years old. Getting in shape is a whole 'nother issue. We all grow at different rates and in different ways. Until the summer of my sophomore year of high school I was 5'9"" and 120 lbs. I grew to 6'2 145 by the next summer without actively doing anything. You are going through a confusing and aggravating time and as much as it sucks you can do something about it through your own actions. Just don't isolate yourself by staying on the computer all day. It can be a nice escape from reality but it is really just a prison you put yourself into.

This is after promising me multiple times that she wouldn't lie or do anything like the first time.  Well, she lied.  She broke every promise, she only cares about herself.  As I type this, she's in the UK (I'm in the US) on vacation for 3 weeks and she met a guy there, they like each other.  She's told me she's considering hooking up with him, because she's leaving this Saturday and it's basically now or never.  Of course, I have no idea if she's saying the truth about not hooking up with him yet, no way to confirm.  For clarification, she is 16 and I am 22.  Right now she's on a golf course with him outside the school she is staying at (school study program for 3 weeks).  It's dark in the UK right now, and she went there with him for privacy.  I fear that when she comes back (perhaps one hour or two...idk :((( ), she'll say they made out and did ""other"" stuff...

I'm just so done with my life.  I have no other friends at all, people exaggerate about this stuff but I don't.  I ONLY had her, she was literally everything.  People say don't put everything in one basket, I did and I lost.  I'm going to end it very very soon.  I can't function at all, I called out for work today.  I keep crying, panicking, my arms feel numb, i have trouble breathing, I have this massive desire to run but where to?  No matter where I go, where I drive, I can't stop crying, I can't escape it.  This feeling is inside me and won't leave.  The first time she cheated, the feeling didn't go away, I was severely depressed from January until may earlier this year.  The thing that made it go away was that we fixed our relationship.  She can't do this to me again, and yet she is...if the person most important to me in the whole world would do this to me, I'd rather just check out of life.  

I'm only writing here because I have no one, I want to speak to her because it's the closest thing to peace I can get, but she's busy flirting and having a good time with some nobody she met on a 3 week school trip.  I hate everything, I'm so tired of feeling these horrible feelings.  I can't make it months and months or years like this.  I'd rather check out into non existence.

Edit 1 @ 5:40 cst: she's still not back from hanging out with the guy, nearly 2 hours alone on a golf course.  They could be having sex for all I know.  I have the most horrible death feeling in my stomach, I can't stop crying.  I don't want to feel this way

Edit 2 @556pm cst: what's do bad about her hooking up with another guy? I don't get it, but to me it feels like the worst thing in the world, short of her dying or being raped or harmed in any way. I can't handle it, why? What's wrong with me? I just want to buy a gun.

Edit 3 @ 6:07pm cst: she contacted me briefly on Facebook.  She didn't say much except that they kissed, and now they're in his room.  She plans to contact me in 1-2 hours.  I can't do this.

Edit 4 @ 7:35pm cst: she's still with him in his room.  Just them.  Idk when she'll contact me.  Idk what they're doing.  I feel sick

Edit 5 @ 8:05pm cst: still no contact.  I don't know what to do.  I just want peace.

Edit 6 @ 8:21pm cst: I called her.  She's making out with him, I disturbed them.  She says she'll be back in her room ""later"".  It's 2:22am in the UK, this is a school trip.  I can't believe they let this stuff happen.

Edit 7 @ 9:45pm cst: she contacted me finally.  We spoke for 20 minutes.  They made out, she was ""teaching"" him to kiss she said.  He felt her legs, she felt his chest.  There was tension, but nothing happened she said.  She's likely going over tomorrow night too.

(I was exactly like you 5 years ago) To be honest, I am the NERDIEST guy alive and it makes me squirm with joy to hear that you exist. On the other hand, I love to have a good time and sometimes that includes alcohol and a party (I prefer small parties with people I know are cool, which really means non-judgmental).

So, if someone like me were to meet you they would probably be very interested at first and then realize that:

1. You live far away. (you said you commute, how far? Consider moving closer?)

2. It would require a big commitment on my part since we would most likely be hanging out one on one which puts lots of pressure on both of us. (another reason you probably feel nervous, believe it or not, the purpose of parties is to diffuse awkwardness and have fun)

So, I would recommend moving closer to your school or closer to a major city if you aren't in one already and DO NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING SILLY. If you say something that makes NO SENSE AT ALL just follow it up with ""wow, one of those days I guess, haha"" or ""what I meant was *insert strange sound and giggle*""

Also, alcohol (in moderation, no one likes to clean up vomit and deal with crazy drunk people) will DEFINITELY help you to flow instead of think about every single possibility before you speak. Maybe consider buying some for yourself and finding a happy medium before you go and rip off all your clothes at a party :).

Seeing a shrink will help a lot (I see one too) but its not the whole answer. If you want to 'fit in' you need to prepare yourself let go a little bit and possibly look stupid a couple times.

Don't stress about it, you're one of the coolest girls in the world already and all I know about you is what you've told me!

P.S. The nerdy guys are definitely very very nervous, disenchanted from years of stupid people, or embarrassed to be shown up by a girl in Ubuntu, hahaha. And I totally agree with Joll.

I'm sorry for giving you lots and lots of suggestions when you are struggling to get through the day.  I wanted to help but it sounds like I didn't tell you anything too useful.  I'm sorry for that.  

Is there anyone who can help you get things done?  If not, and you don't think you can function on your own, another other option is to check yourself into a mental health hospital.  I know that you may not want to do that and I respect that, my thought is that they would be equipped to find resources for you.  For example, in the U.S. there are different kinds of assisted living facilities for people who can not or struggle to function on their own.  There are likely other kinds of programs that could help you as well. 

Also, something that you should know it that (again assuming you are in the U.S.) if you are suicidal and call 911 they have to take you to the hospital and the hospital will keep you for 72 hours observation to make sure you are not a threat to yourself or others.  The people at the hospital also should know of resources and programs that will help you.
   
I hope something here helps you.  I'm sorry that you are going through such a hard time.  I hope that it helps a little to know that there is one person out there who cares about you. - Kat ",,0.0,,2012-07-26 23:47:42,,,0,False,,,,0,,c5jxo21,,,,,t3_x5to4,,,t1_c5jxo21,,,,t1_c5jwbbp,,,,,,,,1429478886.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

As someone who's (mostly) recovered from a severe depression, a purpose serves so well in times like these.

Be it a job, school, a project, anything. A reason to wake up essentially.

It seems SO tough right now, but you've got to get out of your current pattern or you risk just spiralling further and further down into depression and that's very hard to stop at that point.

It can be anything. 

When I was depressed, I joined a dungeons and dragons group. Every sunday, we'd get together and role play and it was incredible fun. To some, it was a lame hobby. But to me, it was something to look forward to. 

From there I worked on getting an education. And from there, I got a job. Having purpose can restore the humanity.",,0.0,,2014-01-08 01:39:58,,,0,False,,,,0,,cek2c3q,,,,,t3_1uo8av,,,t1_cek2c3q,,,,t3_1uo8av,,,,,,,,1431846524.0,,4,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,4,,

Pass through the bad times, mourn them, but go on.

I'm 30. Pretend this is 30-year old you giving you a pep talk. 

Someday you'll think back on this time and hopefully think fondly of the times you and your old gf had together, even though it sucks right now. It was a good chapter in your life, but it's time for a new one. 

You'll look back and be proud of yourself for moving on and growing up. There's still so much you're going to do.

Her jaw especially is very pained, and she's unable to talk at all as a result of her treatments. She's very weak physically, and can't do so much as open her own water bottle. The disease is progressing much more quickly than her doctors anticipated and a specialist is coming in to look at it tomorrow. She's worried that she may be like this for the rest of her life.

She has so much else going on too. Her dad has cancer and is essentially a vegetable, and a lot of kids at school have been teasing her about her inability to speak for the last several weeks. She'just says she can't stand it anymore, and is considering suicide.

She feels like she has no friends. I try to talk to her every chance I get, as does another friend of mine, and we've recruited tow other mutual friends to spread the word that people need to stop being vicious dumbasses around her, although I've left specific details out so as not to start rumors or to fuel the vicious high school gossip machine.

Still, she feels like there's no way out, and she's not in despair or anything, she's just like ""yeah, this is the path that I want to take."" and keeps saying things like ""I like being in the dark, the light at the end of the tunnel is a lie anyway.""

What do I do? Everything I've said to her seems to be counterproductive. I'd like her to get some professional help, but I don't know how to set that up.

I'm obviously easily replaced. I don't really bring anything to the table that anyone else can do as well or better. I feel like everyone else has this and I'm just standing in the way of their happiness. No one wants to pay me what they do everyone else for the same job. So obviously I'm not worth as much. My friends and exgirlfriends have replaced me with other people so I'm not only easily replaceable but I'm not worth keeping around because no one is here and hasn't been for years. I have no family left alive so killing myself would only inconvenience the county employees that clean up messes that people leave behind after they kill themselves. That's really not that big of a deal because they get paid to do this so I'm helping with their job security. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. It's not a fun world to live in unless you have someone to share it with and enough resources to be entertaining all the time to those around you and yourself. All of witch I have none. I really don't want to be around people anymore. I feel drained and am burned out on human interaction. I don't get pleasure out of the creative arts anymore. It all seems repetitive. Everything from video games, to music to literature, it's just a different version of something that happen a few years back or similar to something else going on now. Nothing wows me anymore. I'm tried of exercising everyday to get into shape. It gets old even doing new stuff. I did make progress I lost 40lbs this year but it takes up so much time and I can't eat what I want to. I'm still not attractive enough for people to treat me with a little more respect or women to notice me. It's kind of a big waste of time other than health reasons and I want to die so it's completely pointless. 

Everyday is miserable. I worked so hard this year and all I have is $28 in the bank. No one will give me a chance at a better job because I could never afford college. As things get more expensive it makes live more hard. Soon there will be no way to afford rent and I will have to either go find multiple jobs witch will defeat the propose of having a house because I will spend all my time at work other than a place to sleep. It's just too much effort to keep going on for the lack of rewards. It would be nice to be able to afford a vacation once in awhile just to not worry about where my next meal is going to come from or how can I make this shirt last longer because I can't afford any new clothes until next year. 

I just don't see any reason to live on since everyone else has gotten such a bigger piece of the pie that it leaves me with almost nothing. I can't even help people because I need to be working all the time so I can afford rent and this stupid phone they want me to have at work so they can get in touch with me when I'm not at work. Thanksgiving is next month. I could go to the soup kitchen and dole out turkey dinners for the poor. Then eat with them because I can't afford that food myself or go to someone else's house. A person I don't really know and sit with a family I don't really know real awkwardly. Feel all embarrassed, awkward and drained when I come back home. 

I don't even like browsing the Internet anymore. I see things I want to buy or need on amazon only to be reminded I can't afford it. I don't buy it but just want it. I read stuff on reddit but am depressed by it because people are just kind of rubbing in your face that they have better jobs, girlfriends, families, kids, homes that are real houses instead of an old industrial building you aren't supposed to live in but do anyway.

She said that WE could do something on Saturday because she's hanging out with other people but will with me.. When we said good bye, it was a quick hug because people were waiting on her.. I told her to come back later so we can really say good bye, and she said no.. She said she had to go because it was late, but since it was already really late, a few minutes wouldn't really matter.. I told asked her.. I begged her.. She said that I stressed her out and she never wanted to see me again.. I told her it wasn't fair that she hung out with all of them a lot longer, and I just wanted some time for us.. Even if it was just a few minutes.. She said I was ungrateful because I never appreciate anything she does for me.. I told her I was glad she invited me, but that I didn't really enjoy myself because I felt ignored.. She was taking pictures and talking to everyone else more than me.. I would try to talk, but she was in the farthest dude from me.. Keep in mind that these are HER friends.. I'm not comfortable with them, so it would be nice if she sat by me so I wouldn't feel awkward.. 

After that, we went to the park, and I jumped my head twice.. I told her, but she didn't hear.. I was right next to her, but she started laughing at someone else.. The first tie, I was like, okay.. I didn't say it loud enough.. So I said it louder the second time and was rubbing my head.. She didn't even notice..

The last thing we did was go to a fast food place.. Then came the dreaded subject.. ""Sooo, how's bae?"" She was confused and they said that she told them last week about her liking someone.. Last week.. Not only was I sad about them bringing up the person, but she told them first.. I found out three days ago.. 

I really don't like her right now.. I wish I never met her.. She even said that best friends are supposed to make the stress go away, not bring it to them.. She said that! Agh! She's who stresses me out! I go to her, wanting her to make me better, but she just shuts me out! So she knows what a best friend is, but she can't even be that for me..

I feel really bad.. I want to cry all day.. I don't want to be here anymore.. She says that I'm ungrateful and that if she doesn't see me next time, it's because of me..

She can't even give me a call and calm me down when I'm hyperventilating and choking on my own spit.. I just wanted to calm me down.. She did it on Friday.. She hugged me and wiped my tears.. Why couldn't she do the same yesterday? She takes no blame in what I feel like.. She thinks I can just not feel like it.. She thinks I'm the problem.. And maybe she's right..

I know I wouldn't go through with it, I've tried before a couple of times and ended up in a psych ward for observation and a $15,000 dollar bill. I was released, not diagnosed with anything. I'm a completely normal person, with just too much on my mind. I still miss an ex girlfriend more than anything, and she's made it clear she doesn't want to speak to me. Life goes on right? I'm also an illegal immigrant in the u.s. brought over when I was 8 years old. 14 years later and nothing has changed. I love working, but haven't had many opportunities. When I was 18 I worked overnight at a store, I miss that feeling of clocking in, doing your job, having fun with coworkers, and getting a paycheck in the mail every week. After that, I worked a couple of odd jobs. Last year my cousin hooked me up with a job in Richmond. I stayed there for 8 months, until my boss got deported. Those 8 months were great, working, having enough money to be comfortable, finally moved out of my parent's house. When I lost that job I moved back to my parent's, wallet running dry again. Then my sister gets me a job at her company, back to work. I lasted three months with a boss that always payed extra late, bounced checks, unorganized schedule, overworking myself to rarely make minimum wage. After 4 days of getting forced to work 12 hour shifts and exhausted I quit. Back to this depressing, tiny room in my parent's basement. A month goes by and still no job. I look around and I only have 2 friends, Denny and Johnny, who I love them to death. I am so lonely, all I think about is my ex from 2 years ago. I tried going out, getting drunk (because that's the only way I can talk to strangers) and end up getting arrested. Oh what's this? Before being released they have to notify ICE. Great, now I'm on removal process. Great, I'm facing being sent to my home country which I haven't been to in fourteen years, don't know a single person there. On top of that my parent's spent the last of their money on a lawyer. I wrote a letter to the president two weeks before he announced the thing for children of illegals, I hope he read it and that I may have had an impact for everyone in my shoes. It's funny, my boss in Richmond, the one that got deported? His daughter was valedictorian of her class, but wasn't legal. Accepted into Princeton but didn't have the money for it, so off to brazil she goes. I never told anyone before that I was illegal. So here I am, unwanted in the country I grew up in, pledged to the flag every day in school, can't get a job(because who's going to hire someone that's dealing with ice problems?) can't get over my first love (yeah I'm pathetic, but this girl meant the world to me, and not my most recent one, my first love, my korean ex) I have nothing to offer. I'm as pathetic as I don't have the guts to do it, but hopefully one of these days these sleeping pills and these bottles let me dream of talking to her again, hugging her, holding her close, and telling her I love her.

I don't think you're going to be able to understand it right now, especially since you just have to deal with some practical matters and all. And by understand, I don't mean ""why they are right"". I mean, literally to understand what the fuck is going on in this strange brand of bullshit that is happening in their judgment, why it is so wildly excessive, etc. It basically has to do with a pretty extensive lack of understanding of human nature and conditions. And that seems to have to do at the same time with their religiosity. It seems like the religious part sort of systematically shuts down the understanding human nature part. So it works together as a big congealed mess. How interesting, right? Except when you're the one who's feeling it head on it's not ""interesting"", it's a nightmare. Even so, you've got to try to understand in the future.

You sound like you're adjusted to your sexuality. You know well enough how you're built, what you can and can't change, and that you're a good person at heart. I can sense this. But they lost you in a lot of ways. In time they may actually come around. They were totally unprepared (again, probably because of their kind of religiosity) for the situation that arose. At this point, you do sort of need to allow for something you might not realize: their being *able* to deal with it is, *in the immediate*, in a way on par with your own sexuality. You can't change it. They can't change their immediate reaction. So it's more like: get out of the way and keep your distance as their ignorant minds go into spirals of breathtaking hatred and rejection. That is so fucking sad it's mind-boggling. But then, after time, maybe, *maybe* you can make inroads to helping them see that you are human, real, decent and have to be who and how you are. If you are lucky, one day they will be asking you to forgive them.

It is they who can change. But their fundamentalism is, to be blunt, dangerous. 

I hope in my heart that you will make very good moves right now and find that support that is out there, the *real love* and *real support* that is waiting for your lovely human heart, your true humanity. Don't think all the gay marriage stuff is about nothing: it's about real people, love, real recognition, and a lot of the people who have worked on that issue were thrown out of their family's lives, some rejected horribly. 

Please do this: make good, smart moves now and keep reaching out, networking, getting involved. There is so much out there for you.

I'm not saying you should cut yourself off from them completely, but certainly it seems to me that it would be healthy for you to distance yourself from them. As for meeting people, I completely understand the difficulty you are having. My best recommendation is to find a club, volunteer group, or open study group that interests you and attend it regularly. (This doesn't have to be through your college it could be anywhere in your community/city). Just remember that everyone, especially introverts find it awkward and difficult to meet new people. This does not mean that you are not likeable or that they have any problem with you. The other thing with regards to your friends is that people do change, even if you don't recognize it. If they are in college and have only been living independently for a short time then they are likely focused on themselves (simply because they have to be). Don't take their opinions too seriously.

To set the scene. I am 25 and from the UK. I lost my house in April 2014, since then I have been in a no fixed abode situation, I sleep on floors and couches during the week, and my girlfriends on the weekend. I was fired from my job in January for being too unreliable after I fell ""depressed"" and had two nervous breakdowns and disappeared from work for a couple of weeks. Because I lost my job I'm in quite a lot of debt. My doctor put me on anti-depressants, I didn't finish the course, or ask for anymore as they weren't helping and I felt at the time I wasn't depressed but stressed, to be perfectly honest I still don't think I'm depressed, if anything, I would describe myself as being mentally lost, I have absolutely no self worth. 

My family is, well, they will always open their door for me, but none of them will open their hearts to me or listen to my issues and offer any form of advice beyond ""you need to sort your life out"", or ""you need to get a grip"" etc. Just being in their presence is toxic, my mood drops dramatically when ever I am around them, but I have no choice, it's either their floor, or the street. Everything I own is sat in front of me in a bag, I am eligible for government benefits in which I am receiving, however, in relation to a home, I am very low on the priority list.

I can't remember a day that hasn't gone by this year where I haven't asked myself if I should just end it. I'm starting to feel like a burden on people, I'm starting to feel like they're getting fed up with having to deal with me.

I've told myself that if I don't have anything stable by the end of this year (Job or home) then I'm leaving, but I'm starting to wonder if I'll even make it that far.

This is where the title becomes relevant. Would moving away help anything or would it just be exactly the same but in a different area with even less people I can talk to?

There are many more things that contribute to me feeling the way I do, but like I said at the start, I'm not even brave enough to kill myself so I don't think sharing them will do anything more than bring up a lot of emotion.

I thank anyone in advance for reading this and maybe having a thought about me, I thank you even more if you have any words that may help me.

I'm reading this post back to myself and my dog is just sat there staring at me and crying, I may not be able to reply too quick as I'm going to try take my mind off things and take her for a walk.

At different points in my life I practiced ridiculously self-destructive behavior or scary things, I don't seem like an overly brave person, it is easy to not be scared of real danger with a desire in the back of the mind 'for' self-destruction.  What I have long known is my greatest fear isn't tangible or dangerous, it is failure.  

That said, at a previous juncture in my life, much darker and desperate in reality and emotionally than now, I hung on out of some deeply central pig-headedness.  What I found out then was even locked up, family gone, no freedom or money possibly for 10 years, when I held on even though it seemed I had completely failed that was the only way to not be a failure.  Like letting people down and failing is not truly final or really possible until I gave up.  I have enjoyed a few years since of greater success and growth than I could have imagined.  (Also that other stuff eventually worked out).  While I am currently struggling with many changes and issues with my wife, that earlier lesson has been my greatest strength when suicidal thoughts have returned after all those years.  

You can't really let them down without giving up.  If you wait until tomorrow, that person you let down may need you to help them up (and you'll be there).  Be selfish though, a big part of my self-hate was how i felt i failed or disappointing 'others'.  This is OUR only life!  You don't need to forfeit your only life because you feel like someone else wouldn't be happy with your choices.  Beyond that, you have a MUCH better chance of not disappointing or failing if you don't quit.  It always reminds me of how even in a room of models you have a 100% better chance of getting a date if you ask.  Sidenote: Do NOT marry a model or beautiful woman because good God it is not worth it (that's what brought me back here!)

I've doodled a lot to get through boring lectures and stuff - it's a very effective tactic. At school it's quite easy to stay focused because of the quick pace of classes, and you just kind of keep moving on autopilot. The issue starts when I get home - I'm too burned out to start immediately, so I either nap or watch an episode of a show...then I just can't get to fucking work on anything. I've tried browser extensions that block sites when I should be working, locking down my computer entirely, working somewhere away from all the distractions my bedroom offers, and nothing. I've spent upwards of five hours just doing fuckall with a pencil in my hand staring into space because I didn't want to do my piss-easy precalc homework. My mind hates actually doing **anything** and fights me whenever I try. Whatever tactic you name, I've probably tried it. Nothing fucking works, and I honestly can't name any more frustrating feeling than not even being able to control your own brain. 

An AP class is a college class you take in high school. There's no formal registration, however, you do need excellent grades to qualify for the higher-level ones, and although it varies by school, some teachers require an entrance exam to take it. The AP sciences (physics, bio, chem, anatomy) and calc are the hardest classes in the school, with only about 10-20 students per class (in a school of over 3000) and they are extremely selective about who's allowed to take them.

My boyfriend was extremely possessive and my friends started telling me he was emotionally abusive.  He simply had insecurity and trust issues.  They didn't see that he had every right to be suspicious of me, because I was in fact experiencing the ""grass is greener"" syndrome and talking to someone else, though he didn't really know that part.  The someone else seemed so chill and non-judgmental.  He was always in a good mood, unlike my boyfriend.

I wanted to take a break to get my head on straight, but he refused.  I loved his willingness to fight for me.  I had always thought I had the ""upper hand"" feelings-wise because he was so insecure, so I let him have the upper hand in other areas.

I started to dump my bf because I felt outside pressure to (my friends convinced me it would be a healthy decision) and because I figured if I had feelings for someone else, then maybe I need to think about things.  He finished the breakup, saying I had been acting wishy washy (true), that he wasn't proud of me and my priorities (I had increased partying), and that he believed I didn't love him (false), but left a 24-hr window for me to retract the breakup and prove to him that I did love him.

I texted him at the 24th hour outlining that I did want to be with him and was okay with all of the sacrifices he had asked me to make.  He told me he would think about it.

A week later I wrote an apology letter about how selfish, immature, and entitled I had been acting.  I realized no guy would ever sweep me off of my feet like he did, no other guy would be so supportive, no other guy would love me so much.  Because I realized guys in my area suck.  And the guy I had been talking to I of course realized was never as good as my boyfriend.

He never thought about it.  He admitted he was over it but never conveyed that realization to me until my apology.  For a week I started to really realize he was what I wanted in life, and during that week, he came to the opposite conclusion.

He took some girl he had been talking to toward the end of our relationship out on the valentine's day dinner and dance that was meant for us, and told me he didn't love me anymore.  I hope they don't work out so he can really sit and be alone and realize that he will never find a girl that would put up with his shit or understand him as much as I did.

I feel like I've been made a fool.  He promised me he would always love me, and while I may have easily given in to doubts to end the relationship, he never expressed his doubts to me and silently checked out.  I never stopped loving him (though perhaps at times recognized I was no longer honeymooning), and he so easily gave up on that love, if it was ever even there.  He fucked with my head, although he claims I did that to him.  Why would he finish my break up, telling me I didn't love him, when it was in fact he who didn't love me?

The icing on the cake is that I always asked him to let me know if he felt like he was falling out of love.  He either never loved me, based on the fact that he moved on so quickly, truly loved me but stopped and lied about it, or worse: never loved me and instead only loved controlling me.

If I could go back in time I'd tell myself to stop acting out and to just be the obedient girl he wanted.

It's not fair.  I supported him and never stopped loving him during his depression, but instead he checked out during mine.

and every new guy I meet I just keep comparing to my ex.  every new guy disappoints me.  and my ex has moved on from our 1.5 yr relationship so quickly...in fact exactly a week after telling me I was the love of his life, that he would give me the world, and that he would fight for me.

it's snowing so i was thinking of parking my car somewhere pretty, clogging up the tailpipe, and hitting the sac early tonight.  everyone knows i suck at cars and the old lesabre has had its fair share of issues so it could plausibly be an accident.  

my biggest fear is waking up alive tomorrow.  what if it doesn't work?  what if my car is so shitty it won't work?  should i grab a hose and feed it into the window?  or will clogging it with snow be enough?  i weigh about 100 lbs.



i feel like i've been doing everything right to avoid shitty thoughts.  i go out, work out, try to focus on work when i'm not thinking about how badly i fucked up or how i let someone have so much control over my heart.  i go to bars, go on dates, but have to leave everything before midnight.  the only guy that gets my head off of my ex is that someone else, and even he doesn't compare.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,default,"dumped the love of my life, quickly realized my mistake and instead he dumped me. grass is greener syndrome and an emotional affair ruined the best thing i ever had",9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2w5gwg/dumped_the_love_of_my_life_quickly_realized_my/,

I'm 16/M and I have a issue with migraines. If you're familiar with migraines, they come in different phases. I'm pretty much stuck in an endless cycle of these phases. I haven't had a break since October this year(when this all started).

I don't think I'm depressed or suicidal. But opting out is starting to become very tempting. I have to take meds that have shitty side effects and I'm becoming tolerant to my pain pills. At this point I've sort of given up on getting by with the pain pills and just trying to sleep it off, since I'm a student on holiday till the end of January. My meds are losing their efficacy and I'll have to switch to stronger stuff with even more side effects soon.

A small part of me wants to opt out. I had to get a CT scan to rule out brain cancer and I wanted that scan to turn up positive so at least I'd die soon (it was clean). I don't even know if I'm trying to seek attention or not. I just feel incredibly conflicted on this. I keep swinging between 'I should just gulp all my pills and OD' and 'I don't want to die I want to live on and go to med school and die of old age'.

Over the past few months I've been in a downward spiral. I haven't had fun for ages. Video games used to cheer me up. Now I find them a chore. Books used to be fun. Everything seems 'flat'. I'm regressing into a sort of a loner

I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to upset friends and family. But I keep thinking up plans. Drafting suicide notes in my head. Who to give my stuff away to.

But, when I make that decision to talk to someone/go into treatment, or just go out in the world and socialize with even just one person (maybe a family member or a classmate), I feel like I can chip away at this veil of negativity. Perhaps you can read up on cognitive theories of depression -- you might see that a lot of what you feel, and are describing here, is something shared by a lot of people. 

Perhaps you can consider going to your therapist and being really honest about your suicidal ideation. Your therapist might have some more concrete suggestions on how to deal with them, beyond interpersonal 'talk' therapy techniques. 

I'm not sure what I'm really trying to say, but your description of how you feel sounds really familiar, and there are treatments/ways to get better. Once I make the effort to do so, a lot of my own patterns go away/become less noticeable. 

Also, on the ""girl"" thing... I rarely meet guys who are this self-perceptive in their 20s and early 30s. I think it's really attractive to women, because emotional maturity is in short supply. As soon as you open yourself up to people, I am certain you will have no problem having or maintaining relationships with women.

26918,,True,jmk4422,,,,"Three thoughts.

1.) Don't obsess about girls. Rejection sucks but it will happen many times. I knew a guy once who, when rejected (which was *extremely often*), would just grin afterward and say to me, ""Shit, man, I didn't know she was a dyke!"". Not the most PC thing to say, of course, but he'd say it to me or others with a laugh and quickly move on to the next girl at the bar/party/whatever. Result? 90% rejection but he always had a girlfriend. Last I heard he was happily married, too.

2.) College grades. I've mentioned this before: don't let them stress you out. Yes, a 4.0 is wonderful. You should try your hardest. That said? At the end of the day it's just about the piece of paper. Five years from now no one is going to care whether your GPA was a 3.8 or a 2.1. Look at George Dub: he did shitty in college and wound up the President of the United States. So just get the degree. Focus more on recovering from your depression than on beating yourself up for not getting perfect grades.

3.) You need to get yourself into treatment. Maybe for the alcohol (it sounds like you're self-medicating) but definitely for the depression. Contact your university; most offer free counseling services for students. 

This third point is most important. Despite what others on this thread have suggested, serious suicidal ideation is **not normal**. A normal person might think, ""Hmm, if I just turned the wheel quickly to the left I'd be dead when that 18-wheeler crushed into me! Life is so fragile."". But no **normal** person sits around fantasizing about dying.

One of the first things a good therapist will ask you is, ""Have you had thoughts of suicide?"". If you say yes, they will then ask, ""If you did, how would you do it?"". If you can answer that question in any sort of serious detail that's a big red flag.

So please, get yourself treatment. Don't be ashamed about needing it, either. Some people are wired this way. You should be no more ashamed of it than you would be if you found out you had cancer.

So, I'm not getting ready to off myself or anything, but I'm pretty close. I'm 19, I have a great job that involves general contracting and construction, and I'm in school. Though, I've never been happy. Ever. If something good happens, I only think of the bad that can come from it. And thinking of the good doesn't do much to sway my thoughts away from the bad *if that makes any sense*. As far as girls go, they are a no go. Lost my virginity last year, was whatever for me. I can't really bring myself to get past an introduction with any girl I may or may not like, my brain just won't let me do it. Then I get down for not doing anything about it. Every time I get down, I get really down for no apparent reason. Into an emotional rut that I can never escape, but can only reach my hand out of for a day every 2-3 weeks. All I think about is how those around me judge me, when I know very well that no one gives a crap. I know very well if I continued with what I'm doing in my line of work I'd be successful, but miserable. I can't think of anything that would make me happy. Only time I'm happy is when I'm around my friends (Where I'm also judging myself at the same time), or doing something extreme such as skydiving or something that gives me a rush. I smoke a lot of weed, it helps me ""not care"". But at the same time, I can't smoke too much or I can't function throughout the day, only at night. Sorry to go with all the details, guess I'm hoping for some magical answer to come in that will solve all my problems, it's what I always look for in any situation I'm in. Lately I've found myself googling the easiest methods of suicide, then reprimanding myself for being a pussy and even considering it. So I'm dead locked in a cycle. My depression is not due to anything but myself. Everyone I've talked to has just said to ""stop being depressed.""

Not looking for help or anything, I am young and have a lot to see and learn, so I most likely won't kill myself until I hit 30 or something. Just wanted to share my story and see if anyone else has the same kind of thing going on with them.

106996,,True,nicerthanmostpeople,,,,"I mean, going there won't affect getting a job or anything, but from my personal experience  usually those psych wards just want to stabilize you and get you out of there. Where you would go, in your situation, would be an acute inpatient stabilization unit. nothing overly long term (your insurance has a say in this, too). 

sure you can meet lots of different people and get to talk to others and have a ""safe"" place to stay where you can't do anything to yourself. On the other side of things, it can heavily impact yourself because being a patient at a psych ward can be dehumanizing... and i'd hate to see another person get ""addicted"" to the psych ward life because they feel stable and forget how to live life outside of the ward (no protection, no structure)

If you're really scared of yourself though, then i'd say go for it. sometimes a reality check could help. If you tell your therapist you've been having suicidal idealations/thoughts its not exactly universal that they'd suggest the ""nuthouse"". I say this because therapists are only human. Usually, yes, they'd suggest checking you in somewhere but beginning the process through the therapist can make it really drawn out. 

Who cares what the therapist thinks though. this is about you. Are you stable? if you don't trust yourself and you begin to harm yourself in any way, it's your decision to go the hospital or not. If you do, just tell the folks at the ER that you're suicidal and you want help. They'll get you nice and set up and will ask you a lot of questions. Be honest with yourself and them and good luck. ive had moments where i wanted to go in, i ended up being honest to myself (their questions) at the ER and i didn't get in because of criteria. usually you'll need to have some kind of self-harm done or feel like ""hurting others"", have some kind of noteable uncontrollable psychosis, drug abuse etc... also might be noted one time i wanted to get checked in, only had ""i am suicidal"" to back myself up and wasn't given a 'place in line' for a room in ANY wards in the area because i 'wasn't a big enough threat to myself or others'. if you wanna check yourself in be prepared to possibly be denied placement. 

Well, unless perhaps you went through your therapist, they could get you a referal to somewhere else, but i am not familliar with that process so i cannot be of much help there

anyways, timewise, I'd say anywhere from 1 week to 2-3 months based on the place you go to and their individual rules/structure, and your insurance/money situation. you will probably have your medication changed and you will be bored out of your mind. you will be uncomfortable and you will not have access to your belongings. each ward is different with how strict they are.  ive had 7 trips in my lifetime, if you have any questions let me know. i also had benzo abuse problems in the past and i emphasize if you are craving right now. *hug* good luck. sorry my post is so badly written.",,0.0,,2012-03-04 02:57:19,,,0,True,,,,0,,c3xgg9p,,,,,t3_qffbz,,,t1_c3xgg9p,,,,t3_qffbz,,,,,,,,1428463361.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

It was in a foreign country and the family I stayed with only knew a five mile radius. I made no friends and I did nothing. And just like you I wasn't struggling with anything in specific. What kept me going was knowing that I was going to come back to someone who loved me. What you need to do is not get into a habit. You're so young. And don't listen to everyone else. You know your potential and you can only use it to it's maximum if you are motivated. What motivates you? Do you look forward to college? Are you in a relationshIp? How're friends? You're not a dud. You're just stuck. I know I shouldnt be talking.  At 15 I was similar to that. But eventually these will become people you want to overcome and prove wrong. You are going to do something great. Don't rely on razors or drugs or anything destructive, because that's all it will do: destroy. I know. I relied on a blade for 10 years now. And it's getting difficult to stop. Change up your life. Meet new people. Try a different club. Something that takes you places. I did modelUN in my high school. And I also picked up guitar. When you start changing the routine and keeping busy, it will get easier. But only you can make that stance to change. You're not locked into this. I wish I could have all the answers for you. But I can most definitely tell you, at age 15... Your path can be so great. And right now it might not feel right but it will. I'm not saying it's going to be easy to get out of this mind set but if you work through it, you will see yourself getting happier. And striving for whatever will keep you healthy and passionate about life. The only words that should hold the most weight are those that you tell yourself.

Having said that, I've had some similar thoughts in my time so I think I know what you mean. There are two reasons I can think of to go on living:

1. Curiosity (about what happens to civilization during the remainder of your natural life. Stick around just to see what happens.)

2. It's very likely that there are at least *some* happy times ahead for you that you would miss out on if you terminated your life prematurely.

I've had one shower and brushed my teeth just once since Wednesday. I am ashamed of who I am.   I fly off the handle at what others would consider to be nothing. I am barely putting effort into my degree and I'm being discovered for it. I can think of no good reason to be alive. The only thing stopping me from going right now is that I couldn't bear to leave my parents with the debt that I have found myself with. And I don't even feel they have earned that courtesy. So why the heck should I be alive? You can't regret things when you're dead so I don't buy into that bullshit. I can't think of one good reason.

Back to you, you are only harming yourself by staying in that house. You are not fat, you are not ugly, and you DO have somewhere to turn.

One was the family dog, and the other was my cat.

When I was 15 I had a breakdown, and the onset of psychosis. When the dog would bark I ended hitting it very hard with the broom, I felt powerful, and would continue to hit on various occasions. We ended up giving the dog to the shelter. I never got to make up for what I did. Me and this dog used to good friends, but when my depression came over me I turned into a monster. 

 My purposeful neglect ended with the death of a cat I had for 8 years when I was 21. I miss her. I ignored the sign of kidney failure. I didn't know it was kidney failure. That's not an excuse though. was afraid of the medical bills, I didn't have any money, I can't even take care of myself. I was afraid too ask my dad for help. He was going through a separation with mom, I couldn't find work, we were struggling. I didn't think she would die though, I didn't know how serious it was. She had always done crazy stuff, she was a daredevil of a cat, and always got hurt. But always got better. I knew something was up though. I didn't think of death though. But in all honesty I didn't want to think about it at all. I was too concerned about myself then the cat. 

It wasn't until my sister notice my cats problems that we took her to the vet, and ended up putting her down. The surgery wouldn't of done anything. If I had said something would we be able to something? I don't know, I didn't ask.

A part of me was relived. The cat was a great cat, but despite being a daredevil she also always had health issues. I'm weak, and stupid so taking care of the cat became difficult. So when they put her down I was relived. I was cold, I was evil, I was even in my mind thinking I didn't want a surgery, I was hooping for it to be terminal so I wouldn't have to take care of her. 

If wasn't until she died I realized how horrible it was. When I came in to put her down, she was os happy to see me. She thought she was going home. 

  

 I was an asshole. I hate myself. I knew she was sick, and I did nothing. 

I was never abused myself, I did grow up in a cult, but I was never sexually abused, and or hit myself. 

I'm scum, I'm a horrible person, and the only solution I can think of is suicide, or just crawling away in a hole, and waiting till I die. I don't deserve love, I don't deserve anything I want out of life. I want to feel pain cause I'm a bad person. I hate myself, I can't live like this. But I can't let myself move on. How can I move on when I've done this? 

I've talked to my therapist about it. But nothing seems to help. I want to die.  

If I killed myself I would set the scales right. Even it out. And I can't go on anymore with this on my conscience. The guilt is eating away at me. ",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,default,Former animal abuser,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2cdyhl/former_animal_abuser/,

4183,,True,frumpi,,,,"Actually i have experienced depression. I just choose not to speak of it because happiness is the journey i am on currently. 

I was clinically depressed from around 7th grade to around the end of 9th grade. I even developed an extreme stress induced form of OCD. I know what troubles and obstacles you face and know that facing them alone is a struggle that can be absolutely daunting. I have had 3 therapists in my short lifetime and really tried to turn my life around for the better.

Even though my life in your opinion has been ""happy"", that still doesn't mean i can't sympathize with your troubles.

I see suffering as a fork in the road. One path is short and reveals where it leads before you choose it. The other is long, winding and at times absolutely unpredictable. Life is not about being happy all the time. We define our emotions through what they are not. Without sadness you would never truly know what happiness is. 

A soul ending a suffering life is devastating. They chose the short path. Traveling into something like life can be absolutely terrifying. I for one am scared of the dark because as a species we fear what we don't understand. But life is a risk and a fear we all travel through together. You aren't alone. I would rather you travel this journey with me and see where it leads instead of taking the other path and not knowing what could have happened tomorrow.

At one point I told her ""just because *you* don't want me feel this way doesn't *prevent* me from feeling it"" - and it was like I had slapped her in the face.

While we were together, my ex would *always* contradict my attempts to *be* a parent to our children. The only reason why my youngest ever got potty trained is because my mother came down and made her do it. Every time I would be the stern enforcer, my ex would undo whatever discipline I had laid out as soon as I left the room. Eventually I got so frustrated with my ex-wife's ""don't listen to your father, listen to me"" attitude that I stopped interacting with our kids altogether. And that's when she started with criticizing me for my non-involvement.

Even to this day, their mother refuses to let them have any interaction with me that isn't under her supervision. A couple years ago, their mother and I got into a bit of a row, which left her very upset. Minutes after hanging up with my ex, I get another phone call from my youngest who tells me how angry she is because of how I upset their mother - but all during the phone call I heard my ex telling her what to say. When I finally said ""I respect that you are angry with me, but I want to hear what *you* have to say."" At which point her mother snatched the phone from her and berated me because I was implying that our child wasn't intelligent enough to talk to me like an adult.

At this point, I don't know what I can do - my self-esteem isn't exactly sparkling, and I have difficult enough time standing up for myself as it is.

As a matter of fact, my childhood was great.  But my head is not and has not been for a long time.  I've never actually been diagnosed with depression, but that's because I've never seen a psychiatrist due to the fact that I think it would send me down a spiral that would end up killing me.  Just as a result of my personal beliefs about what aspects of life should be left up to natural progressions and shifts in perspective, free of medication.

I went to a top-notch private high school, where I got along with literally everybody, but could never say that I actually fit in.  I graduated HS in 2007 (barely) and enrolled in a state school.  This was very underwhelming for a graduate of this high school, which sends so many to the most prestigious schools all around the country.

My first year at the state school started off great, though in the back of my mind I couldn't stop thinking about how unfortunate it was that I had ended up at this school.  I'm much smarter than my academic efforts show me to be.  But I digress.  My first semester, I started to notice that I had this big ominous fear of *everything*.  I still went to my classes about 2/3 of the time, but ended up failing two out of five that I had registered for.

There was the backlash from my parents who were footing the bill on my education, but I had decided to give the spring semester a shot.  I started off working just as diligently, if not more than the previous fall semester.  But I promptly discovered LSD, ecstasy, and cocaine.  The fear crept back in.  And it was worse than it ever had been before.  My dorm roommate had moved out of my room leaving me in a double-as-a-single, so I was free to be as much a worthless piece of shit bum as I wanted to be.  I secluded myself.  I spent entire days in bed.  I would lie on my bed and watch the television, drifting in and out of sleep sporadically throughout the day, afraid to even emerge from my room for fear that I would have to explain to my peers the reasons that they haven't been seeing me around.  Eventually, the end of the semester came.  Move-out day was such a horribly crass reminder that I had no friends and had essentially become a living dead.  I was the only person on my floor who didn't have anyone to help re-stack the furniture correctly.  I ended up calling my old roommate to ask for his help.  I could see the pity on his face.  With the end of the semester, I had to own up and tell my parents that all the things I told them about how well I was doing were just a big lie.  Plain and simple.  This would become a recurring theme for the next year and a half, which leads me here.

I moved back in with them, thinking that this shift in dynamics, a change of scenery, would help me get my head on straight.  At this point, I was so desperate for any sort of change that I had allowed myself to flunk out of school in order to attain it in a way that was relatively easy to explain to those who I didn't want to be worried for my health.  I never want people to be worried for my mental health, and I am always putting up a front, and a damn good one if I do say so myself.  I live two lives.  In one life, I am an outgoing, caring, happy young man who sees a bright future.  The foil, however, is that there's nothing of substance on the inside to back it all up.  I've become an illusion.  Over the years, my parents have learned to pick up on the fact that they can't simply believe the things I say just because I say them.  So my lying has become more elaborate, and almost like a god damn full time job.  It would be easier for me to just do the work that is required of me, but I've already lost that privilege.  I have failed all of my classes this fall and am now suspended for the next term from the community college.  My parents do not know this yet.

And that leads me to where I am now.  Right now I am in a library while my parents think that I'm out on a day-long romp with my girlfriend, who, by the way, I do sincerely love very very much.  Well, she's busy all day today so here I am finding ways to dodge having to confront my parents and tell them that I've let them down entirely yet again.  I will be seeing her later on this evening.  I'm mentally preparing to go to the train tracks after I drop her off tonight, lie down on the rails while I watch that fantastic liberating single headlight approach me, feel the rumble of the steel and hear the horn blaring as if to warn me of something I am doing voluntarily as I stare it down and smile back... Then I will close my eyes and hope that I don't wake up.

I just can't help but feel like my failures are all that define me, and that I am incapable of bringing myself to ever change things for myself.  My two true loves are music and my lovely girlfriend.  Yet the negatives of sticking around to see how my shitstorm of a life that I've created for myself are far outweighing the positives, at least this afternoon.

I suppose my biggest plight is that everywhere I look, everybody is struggling.  And it's tragic.  I don't believe there is a very bright future for any of us, save for a select few.  I feel like I've had a good run, gotten my cheap thrills out of life, and want to check out before I have to even look at the bill.

After reading some of the other posts on here, I find that my story may just make me sound like I'm whining about everything.  That I'm some sort of pussy or something.  Well, maybe I am.  Maybe I can't take it.  Not to be preemptively defensive against y'all but I think that any reasons anybody has for feeling the way I feel are just as valid as any others.  I'd love to be proven wrong, though.

I wouldn't kill myself out of spite, or anger, or even disappointment.  Matter of fact, the feeling I'm going to get when I take my last breath will be arguably my biggest accomplishment of my adult life.

I thought WE were happy. 

I guess I ignored the warning signs and the issues she was having because I assume that if I'm happy then she is too. I was so stupid. I became content. I became comfortable. I stopped putting in the effort necessary to keep her happy until it was too late. 

She is gone now. Well, to phrase it better I'm gone because she wants me to be. She made it very clear we were through. She wants to start figuring out how to divide up our bills and our assets. I can't go through it. I can't do it.

33973,,True,[deleted],,,,"OK!! Sounds like you've found your enthusiasm again :-) 

Now music.  Do it - studying the thing you are most passionate about is *definitely* the right thing to do.  However, be smart as well while you are at it.  May I offer a few thoughts on this?  Having a degree in any performing arts can lead to job problems if you haven't thought about any direction other than pure performance.  Let's face it, there are very few symphony orchestra players, top level rock stars, Broadway or Hollywood actors in the overall scheme of things.  I'm not saying don't aim for that, but  my suggestion is this - structure you degree so that it allows *flexibility* of career paths.  If you enter the pure performance stream, and make the grade and stick with it, bravo and good luck, but if you have other options on the go as well, your choices are far greater when you head out into the world.  

Just a few thoughts on that then - my first thought was performing arts journalism (your writing skills indicate that you have definite strengths in that area), but some others are stage, radio or tv production, music composition (film scores, tv shows, stage shows, educational music, as examples), teaching, film, or even the business of concert and event coordination and production.  A degree in music with practical skills attached will be so much more useful.  I'm saying all this because I recently did a music degree as a mature age student and watched with interest (and in some cases concern) as young students came and went.  Squeeze all you can out of the career advisor people and get specific about career paths available with your music degree.  Then build in your smart options when you pick your courses.  

Don't stress about the desire to ""meet as few people as possible"".  I think you are right, and that it will change as you go through college.  Any performing arts course is going to require a fairly large amount of participation anyway, and you are going to find yourself immersed in so many enjoyable activities that it will become easier and easier to relate to other people.

I know the feeling when you are so low and disconnected that there doesn't seem to be any place to go and the only answer is to disappear. It sucks and I'm sorry you are there. Killing yourself or even threatening to do so isn't going to change things the way you think. You're living your life in the eyes of strangers right now, focussing on other people to value your existence. Fact is, most people don't give a shit about you, or I. That's something you have to realize and it took some time for me to really ""get"" that you have to value yourself first. 

First I think you need to accept that you have hearing loss and stop hating yourself for it. Maybe it's the self hatred that makes you unattractive to people and therefore hard to connect with? And you need to do whatever you can to gain some self confidence and self respect. I can't stress this enough, this will save your life. 

You'd be surprised at how good doing something physical will make you feel. And if you allow yourself, it is pretty easy to enjoy yourself even for a moment. And then when you find yourself smiling or feeling good, even for a couple minutes, you start to look at suicide as the biggest mistake you could have made, when all you had to do was give a little effort to make YOURSELF happy. 

Hopefully this helps, but I know how little words can really change how you feel. Just start slow, maybe go for a run or bike ride, give your parents a hug.

I'm male, have a boyfriend. In my country, sodomy is still an offence, but the government ""won't enforce it actively"". Yet there are still several cases where people have been prosecuted, arrested, detained, etc.

Because of that official statement though, and my country's efforts in sweeping the issue under the rug, I won't be able to get asylum somewhere else because of the strict ""active prosecution"" requirement.

Then there's the whole asian family thing. I've conformed, studied hard, kept my relationship secret, graduated, got my practicising certificate as a lawyer in my country. Doing what I can to make my parents content. 

But it's never enough ""when are you going to get a girlfriend?"" etc etc.

I've tried to talk to them about my boyfriend, but it was pushed aside and the next day they simply pretend it didn't happen.

Currently I'm in the UK. I've quit my job and went 50k into debt to pay for a masters degree in hopes of finding a job here. 

Yet to get qualified as a solicitor in the UK I'll have to do another 4 years, starting from a trainee again. No firm is willing to take me on on the qualification transfer scheme. I've tried looking for non-lawyer jobs as well and it's all a dead end.

My boyfriend is not in a better off position that I can just run off with him and leave everything behind. While he's American, he sort of messed up his college degree and is fixing it now. So he doesn't have a job at the moment too.

My year in the UK is ending and I don't know what to do. Exams are coming up and I've been binging on MMO's as a form of escapism. I don't know what's going to happen after. I don't want to go back to my country.

But I don't know where to begin. It's all been such a long time. The little details of this whole thing have drizzled away, but the big blocky events still stand in my memory. And I know there's no future left for me to keep running for. My current situation seems like that. And I feel it's appropriate that I should explain all the history, no matter if it could have played a part or not in what I'm feeling now. *Details and names have been changed to protect the innocent*. **For the sake of presentation, I've split up all of this into Acts. So much has happened that I don't even know what's relevant. Sorry if this structure looks pretentious. This is going to be a long post.**

*Act I*

Spring 2011. I'm 14 years old. I go to a little quiet school in England that's extremely good. And I mean good. But I was young. The quality of my education wasn't on my mind at the time. What was on my mind was just going to school, doing what was expected of me and then going home to forget what I just learned. At the time, I was a huge fan of video games, horror, shooters, platformers, you name it. And I was a devious little bastard, that's for sure. What I did was that I wanted to buy all the unsuitable games that I shouldn't have played. Games like God of War III, Mortal Kombat or even Call of Duty. Because of my obvious age look, I then just asked people in the higher years if they could buy this stuff for me, with money that I had and gave them to do so, and they did. Looking back on it, it just makes me embarrassed. However, one guy that was cool with it, for some reason, he was really nice about it. We'll call him Mark. He drew my attention. So I became very good friends with him. Mark, as it turns out, was one of the very few friends that I realised that I had. So soon afterwards, I also became very good friends with his girlfriend, we'll call her Amy. I spent a lot of my time with Mark and Amy, and they seemed glad that I was around. And I loved it.

Skip to July 2011. Mark and Amy are in fact in their last year in my school. They leave.

*Act II*

I didn't realise it, but Mark and Amy's departure would only serve as a major catalyst for a year-long depression for me that would ensue, as I was strangely feeling down at the time anyway. I don't want to talk about it. So much happened back then. I don't want to bore you as much as I probably am already. A few standout moments included my depression somehow resulting in the principal of my school being forced out of a wedding ceremony due to a storm of oncoming e-mails about me that he received while he was there. If you want to know anything more, please ask me. There is indeed so much more. The only thing that came out of it was a poem I made at its peak. If you guys want to read it, then please also ask me in the comments. But what I can say is that Amy cut off all contact with me as soon as I had finally finished the depression. I don't know why to this day. And it broke my heart.

September 2012. I'm nearly 16 years old. I'm now in my last year. Just like Mark and Amy. Examinations have taken their toll on me. I'm not depressed, but I'm still a loner. To this day, I can't even remember when I last went to a party. From September to July 2013, I work for my exams. I work, work, and work. And I end up getting into college with near-perfect grades in the Humanities. But I didn't feel that much happier. I hoped college would turn out to be the end of all this.

*Act III*

Present Day. I'm 17 years old now. Now both Mark and Amy have stopped contacting me and never answer any texts or calls that I make to them. But now I'm indifferent. I'm in college. I don't care anymore. But I don't still get invited to parties or have many friends. I still spend my weekends and holidays sitting at this computer and doing nothing with my life. I've come full circle.

The only glimmer of hope I have is a dream job that's extremely special to me. I don't want to say what it is in case of embarrassment because I don't know what you will think. All I know is that if I got this job, I'd never feel like this again. The problem is that this job just seems impossible to get. I'd need to find money to even prove myself that I can do what's required. And then I'd have to be noticed. But I do have a backup if I never make it, which is to study in law. But Law's not exciting or interesting to me anyway, but it best suited my abilities. However, I don't want to live in a life where I'm not that happy in living. This is the reason why I'm typing these words. I just see no point anymore unless I got this dream. My days have gone back to empty. My dream isn't worth running for. My backup isn't worth enduring for, and the road I'm on now isn't worth exploring for.

168986,,True,ice_mouse,,,,"First off, don't do anything. Don't take all your pills, don't force an accident, don't pull any triggers. 

Your story resonated with me - my dad died unexpectedly when I was 16, and that was 15 years ago. It certainly gave me a more morbid outlook on life.

You're in a dark place. It'll pass. It may take hours, days, months, but in time it will pass. I have a lot of the same negative self-talk you described. I wish I could tell you some super inspiring thing to make it vanish, but I can't. Just trust the loved ones in your life - I know it's hard to feel like they are giving you an honest opinion when you share these sorts of feelings, but they are there because they care about you, don't think you're stupid, and would notice you disappearing.

As far as your more recent ADHD diagnosis, I teach at the local university, and it's amazing how many students meet with me when they're struggling in class only for them to finally visit the student help center and find out they have some sort of learning disability. It sucks it wasn't caught and addressed sooner, but hopefully now some pieces fit together for how you need to think/learn. The best I can say there is now you know, now you can figure out how better to deal with the cards you've been dealt.

Finally, if you're feeling this way on all those meds, you really should get in to your psychologist or general doctor. Your body might have adapted to one or more of them, the combination isn't working anymore, or something.

Means nothing?  If you're creating stuff (writing, music, etc) even if no one hears it or reads it, it means something to you.  Its worthwhile, it has merit because it captures where you are at a certain point in life.  The only person you have to satisfy is yourself.

Going through hard times like these are the very things that are going to make you a successful person down the line.  Struggling, suffering defeats, and overcoming the limits you set on yourself are the things that make you who you are.  

As for relationships- they'll come along when they come along.  20 is a weird age because most people are very much entrenched in hook up culture and not on the surface looking for relationships.  I'm 24 now- believe me, the sexual marketplace becomes a lot more clear the older I get.  It's easier to gauge people's intentions and identify those looking for hook ups vs. relationships.          

Long story short, don't kill yourself- if not for yourself, then for your mother.  She doesn't deserve to find the son she brought life to and devoted every waking moment toward making successful and happy with his brains splattered all over a wall in his bedroom.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just speaking a little will be all I need. Maybe by the time I hit submit I will be better off and realize that suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem, or what have you. I honestly don't know, but I figure if I can at least get some of this off of me, then maybe, just maybe it will lighten my load to press on, even if only for one more day.

I will give you some very, very quick back story. I am diagnosed BiPolar NOS w/ Moderate-Severe Depression, and Light-Moderate Environmentally Stimulated Anxiety. I am on Disability, yes, shame on me. Only 21 and I can't even keep it together.

Anyways, there, troll away as to how I abuse the system, it's fine. Take a shot. Everyone else I know either dodges the subject in awkward ways, or tries to find me jobs, or out right says ""You seem too happy."" So fuck it, you know you want to. Heh.

I don't even know where I was going to go with this post. I mean, I'm just sitting here, with a partially full box of ice cream left over from my Fiancee's birthday melting, fork protruding, because I was to lazy to wash a spoon.

Today I woke up crushed, and it is one of those days where I know I am feeling like I just want to end it all, but can't. I feel like I was doing so good.

Fuck it, I'm going to be honest. I was doing good. I was smoking pot. No I didn't use the Government's money to buy it, I'm not a fucking scumbag. Anyways. My fiancee doesn't know. She is absolutly against it, and it has been a running theme for our over six year relationship. Not specifically with pot, but everything. We were kids when we met and got together. It's a long story.

Anyways. Yes, I had weed, it helped me accept the things I couldn't change, and honestly, helped me change the things I could. It made me feel like a scientist about everything. I picked up hobbies, I started venturing out of the house (on foot) to explore and take in nature. I for once felt like I was getting better.

It's weird though. It's not like I'm addicted. I'm not going into convulsions, my mind just basically reset. Everything I had been coming to terms with has reverted, everything I had been coming to understand now feels like there is no meaning. And now here I sit, exactly how I was before I every tried it.

I don't know what to do because like any person who is suicidal, I want a reason to live. I want a reason to put the pills away, the blade down, but what is the fucking point? I am on meds, and they make me better than I was before them. Before them I would have constant Mixed States, and rapid swings (sometimes multiple in the same hour).

But where the fuck do I go from here? I don't want to go sit in a hospital I can't afford. I don't want to sit at my desk looking into a monitor watching everyone else live happy. Yes I know I have family I would hurt, a fiancee who may never truely get over it, but if the only thing keeping me here is the oppinions of other people, then I think I'm here for the wrong reasons. I don't want to live in my world, sad all the time, just so that others don't have to feel the pain of my passing. Torture myself to keep others happy? Sounds like a plan?

I am a college student, and my story is fairly generic, I guess. I met a girl at the beginning of the school year who was a friend of a friend. I didn't really think much of her at first since I wasn't initially attracted to her. But since we shared so many friends, we ended up spending a lot of time together, basically every day. I fell in love with her. (this is usually where most people say ""no, you just have a crush on her."" it's not a crush. I've had crushes before. This is different). I realized I was friend zoned at first, and this bothered me. But I thought, at least for the moment, that I could live with that. I thought, ""who knows? I wasn't attracted to her when I met her. Things can change.""

Then later in the year, one of my friends made it pretty blatant that he was also interested in her. He was very intimate with her, despite the fact that they weren't going out, weren't in a relationship, had never hooked up, etc. I became jealous and sad and angry. I couldn't really hide it from her. She realized I was angry and depressed, but I'm not sure if she realized why. I don't *think* she did.

This happened for a couple of weeks. I have been a good student for most of my life. But for these few weeks, I could not concentrate on anything. Whenever I tried to do homework or study or anything, I would just constantly think, ""what if they're going on a date right now? what if they're having sex right now?"". I could not take it. I would try to be around her as much as possible to try to convince myself they weren't going out. So not only could I not concentrate on my work, but I wouldn't have enough time for it either. My grades suffered as a result.

Eventually I learned that she was not and was never interested in him. This provided great temporary relief, because she made clear to him that the intimacy was not okay.

But somewhere in this time, she became cold towards me. We were pretty close friends before all this shit began. I tried to talk to her about it, and it seemed everything was resolved. But it seems now, she only pretends to be friends with me. She may have realized that I like her, but I don't think that's it.

Typing all this out, this seems like a dumb reason to be depressed. But you have to understand that for my entire life, I have thought it impossible for a girl to like me. Why? Because no girl ever has. In fact, girls seem repulsed by me. Until this year, I had never had any close female friends. Acquaintances at best. And not only do I think girls don't like me, but I don't even like most girls. The crushes I have had in my life have been few and far between, and this is the only person I have ever loved. I just don't think it is possible for there to be another person like her. I certainly have met no one.

I have tried talking to my friends about this. But the advice they all give, which is utterly useless, is ""just get over her."" That is not possible. I am not the type of person who can just get over stuff.

I have tried talking to her over summer, even though I can't see her... but it does not seem that she has any interest in talking to me, even as a friend.

I am so sad right now. She was the only girl that I liked who gave 2 fucks about me... and now that is gone. Today I considered drowning myself. I filled up my bath with water (it's quite big), and then drained it. I have had suicidal thoughts and fantasies for a lot of my life. But it has never been this strong. I want to jump off a building, or shoot myself. I simply cannot take this.

It's alright to feel scared, and even to call things off now. If you still feel like there is a decision to be made, it may help to set a date, say the 24th April, when you will make that choice.

Until then, you can worry, stress, write down lists, and think about life and all the issues, absolutely everything about how you feel and what the future holds.

After that date, you will be committed, and focus on doing what you need to do to support her, yourself, and possibly her/your child.

I have to say I totally relate to you when you say that you feel like everything is predictable. Like the world ran out of ink, that life feels like that one dude at the office that keeps forgetting he's told you the same joke a hundred times. When I had those troubles, first I was just really upset with the world. I blamed it for my apathy, for the colours of my life that it dulled, and the sense of doom it plagued me with. It made me cynical, much like you described yourself: bitter, because everyone and everything felt like it was a current flowing one way and I was the only dude swimming against it. I felt alone in my struggling, and all because I was clever enough to see the world for what it really was.

And I think it was in that which led me to my introspection. I was so jealous of everyone else's ""ignorance"", but it was that analysis of everything, which assumed something wrongly of all others and of the world in general, which was my undoing. That assumption was that everyone else is happy, or at the very least, content. My problem lay in coveting that, and in doing so felt a great hole in my existence.

It took me too long to realise that really, in my realisation, happiness and contentment aren't what's important. Happiness is fleeting and superficial. It'd be like wanting a kiss to last forever. What *is* important is the affect you have on the lives of others, the kindness you exude, your willingness to accept the wrongdoing in your life and make yourself better for it. I feel responsible for the life I've been given, and even if I wish I had never been given it, you better be damn sure that I'm not going to let it go to waste. It's out of adversity that we truly find who we are my friend.

You've had a huge impact on my life - you've made me think about myself and what I believe my reasons are for carrying the fuck on whether I like it or not. And I think that's important.

My sister came, though and helped me to get through it. Its already been six years now and sometimes I have to say I still wish I could go with him. I miss him. But I have family that's still alive and they need me. 

I think your family needs you too. It sounds like you've all been through alot lately and need each other even more for support. Maybe you will need to find someone to help you look after your mental health. Its nothing to be ashamed of. Being the victim of a confidence scam is nothing to be ashamed of either. It happens to many people every year and shame helps the confidence artist get away with the crime. If this is what you are illuding to in your post, please realize that it was not your fault and could have happened to anybody.

Life has beat you up recently. Unfortunately, it does that from tiem to time, but don't let it get to you. You will heal emotionally and spirtually over time, just like you would if someone beat up up physically. You may have scars. They may hurt and look ugly, but they aren't everything. They don't make YOU ugly. You're still you, beautiful, irriplaceable you. You will get through this, day by day.

I'm a college student. Aviation Science major, Audio Production minor, and a long time musician, but even flying and recording have lost their magic. I'm also genderqueer, and have major dysphoria in this male body. It's been a major cause of suicidal tendencies in the past for me, and now it's starting to come back. While I have been depressed and suicidal in the past, there really hasn't been any correlation to anything specific that brings my mood up. I just get horribly depressed and suicidal for weeks, then go back to being mildly depressed. At the moment it seems to be the culmination of losing motivation, being discouraged by my male body, and not seeing a point to anything. But I don't know why. There's no reason for me to not have motivation.
At the moment I'm just feeling really empty. Nothing I used to enjoy sparks my interest anymore. I go to work, come home, go to school, stare at reddit for a bit, but can't bring myself to do things I used to love. It seems like too much effort to do anything. I try to play video games I used to love or play instruments, but get bored after a couple minutes. I can't bring myself to hang out with anyone, only occasionally talking to friends online. Investing anything into a relationship just feels pointless when I could be on my own doing whatever I want.

I always dreamed of being an international pilot and playing gigs with musicians all over the world, but it all just seems so distant and impossible at the moment. It's as if there's a deep smog over everything, and I can't even smile, let alone laugh. Alcohol and drugs don't help at all (in fact they make me more depressed), so I've been completely sober for the past long while. I'm not on any medications, I'm eating healthily, and I'm living a relatively balanced life. I shouldn't be feeling this way. I don't have an excuse to feel this way. I feel empty, directionless, the smog of depression choking my thoughts and emotions.
I just want that electricity and 4.0 student motivation that I used to have a year or two ago. Everything is empty. I don't see any purpose to life anymore. There's no more magic.

I don't know if you've already done that and I'm sure it's the last thing you want to think about right now, given everything else going on, but if you make the decision to keep going it might be worth investigating.

Regardless, getting denied disability must be so disheartening and discouraging. I wish we had more and better social programs available so that everyone who needed assistance could get it. And you definitely sound like you need the help.

It makes my blood boil that your family has rejected you for not being religious or cis. That is fucking terrible and you don't deserve it.

7383,,True,Suddenwords,,,,"Hey night777,

Am I too late? Maybe I am. I hope I'm not. If you're still around, I'm hoping you'll read this.

When I was younger, I had the best potential out of all my friends and family. I skipped a whole grade when after fifth grade, making me a very young middle schooler. I carried on this tenacity about my studies up until I received salutatorian at high school. I was bested by a kid of brilliant uprising. 

Fast-forward, I was accepted into a very prestigious school to study neuroscience as it was always my passion. Although I did well, there were many things I noticed that are similar with your current situations.

1. My parents never let up on the idea of me being superlative compared to every other student they know even against my conveyance of individual, subjective challenges. They thought that no matter what, if grades slipped, it was because *I* lacked the fundamental drive to study. That was not true. I had many things going on in life.

2. My guilt was overwhelming sometimes. My guilt of always performing led to abstain from an active social life -- one that I wanted after years of not having on. And because I became anguished from not being part of a social life I deeply wanted, I became more frustrated. The root cause perpetuated itself manifold into all aspects of my life, to the point where there were days I did not show up to class and instead took trips with my car, having notified nobody about my whereabouts. 

3. I thought that my position was unfair. I thought it was unfair to have so much expectation pressed upon me where if I deviate even the slightest from my parents' projections of where I'll end up being, I'll be shunned. There were points where I *almost* thought I was. While my parents are close to me, as they are now, I almost always feel as if they were never %100 appreciative of who I was up until after graduation when I told them I would take a back and defer my masters. They were shocked, but I laid out a plan of what I wanted to achieve in life, and sometimes, that wasn't in line with what *they* wanted me to achieve in life. They understood and we carried on.

Like SQLwitch eloquently puts it, life is in your hands. But that does not mean you full control of it. Life isn't a narrative of just *you*. It's a thread that contains you. But the cool thing is, you get to control a local area of that the miles and miles of webbing that connects everybody in your life. What you do, if you think of it as a literal web, creates ripples that affects everybody else. Your parents, much like an axon to your neuronal cell, have a very strong and thick connection to your web. They're trying, in earnest, to look out for you. In fact, isn't that why they're paying all this money? There is no need for any abrasion between you and your parents. Look at it from their perspectives time to time and see how they're feeling. Then come back to your own. You're getting an education that is paid for. You get to enjoy moments of freedom that many children in this world dare not dream of. You're getting a chance to write things and read things that open up your mind to the beauties of the complicated world through narratives that have crafted and polished to suit the fecundity of college students. I won't say that your life is easy because being a college student never is. But imagine this. Imagine overriding that voice in your head that says ""no. you can't do this."" and subsuming it with a voice that says, ""Easy. Tired? Take a quick break. Lots of work? Partition it down. Friends asking you to drink? Drink when you're celebrating not as a distraction, etc."" You are on a journey that many other millions of people are going on. You can't opt out now. You must finish this race strong. I believe in you. And while it may not look like it, your parents believe in you. We all believe in you. 
--------
Sorry if this comment is too long; I've been inclined to write longer and longer comments recently. I just want to say that there are many ways to break down work. You can always cut down distraction. You can break down the work in pieces. You can always find people to form study groups with. A lot of the solutions are solutions that require you to self-motivate. I know it's asking a 20 year old a lot. But if you don't learn prioritizing now, then it'll be difficult for you to learn it later on. I'm sorry of this advice doesn't have the same tender tonality as others. I'm speaking from experience. It's time stand up and tell yourself quitting isn't an option.",,0.0,,2012-11-02 00:23:43,,,0,False,,,,0,,c6v31a0,,,,,t3_12gzyl,,,t1_c6v31a0,,,,t3_12gzyl,,,,,,,,1430297026.0,,0,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,0,,

I suggest talking to them about this and to avoid having you sent away. Because that means they wouldn't even be able to see you and would probably be more expensive for them and give you a different from ""average"" experience of growing up. 

I myself was hospitalized for about two weeks. Even though it was tremendoussly helpful, there were some negatives. 

You could also keep it up and ask for help or friends to talk to. The internet is where I met lots of people to talk to and they helped me much more then my parents or a few therapists did. It all matters about finding a way to get your emotions out, and cutting is one of those ways, but it is unhealthy. Talking is much better.

Do you want to get your degree? Also; what is your major? 

I hear that you have quite a bit of pain, and that you feel worthless, alone and afraid. It seems like you are trapped in an awful situation, and cant see any way out. 

Do you know why you are so often afraid? 

I dont know where you live, but in some places you can get free counseling.  It is possible that this maybe an option in your area. Have you thought about looking in to it? At least for me, talking to someone on the outside can make all the difference.  

From what I can tell you have accomplished great feats already. Growing up in the environnent you described is impressive on its own, but then having the desire and the drive to go on to college and try to do what you want with your life, its more than many people ever dream of. A friend of mine once told me that he didn't plan for five years from now, or even one year from now. No, he simply took life two weeks at a time. He set out what he wanted to accomplish in those two weeks, and then worked on doing that. Once those two weeks were up, he would set goals for the next two weeks, and so on and so fourth. It worked for him and, if you choose to, it is something you could try.

 it sounds like you might be sensitive to other peoples energy.. you could do some aura-chakra work and learn ways to redirect negative energy. but it might be early in the game for you to be exploring those tools. maybe not. i use some psychic tools to get by but i dont really like to talk about them. PM me for more on any of that. i dont chant with crystals or anything, more just positive visualizations and grounding/protection techniques. 




you might also be an HSP, highly sensitive person. [check this out for more info](http://www.hsperson.com/pages/test.htm). the book is really good and i used a lot of tools in it for dealing with social situations. it explains why i am the way i am. 




from Amazon: Are you an HSP? Are you easily overwhelmed by stimuli? Affected by other people's moods? Easily startled? Do you need to withdraw during busy times to a private, quiet place? Do you get nervous or shaky if someone is observing you or competing with you? HSP, shorthand for ""highly sensitive person,"" describes 15 to 20 percent of the population. Being sensitive is a normal trait--nothing defective about it. But you may not realize that, because society rewards the outgoing personality and treats shyness and sensitivity as something to be overcome. According to author Elaine Aron (herself an HSP), sensitive people have the unusual ability to sense subtleties, spot or avoid errors, concentrate deeply, and delve deeply. This book helps HSPs to understand themselves and their sensitive trait and its impact on personal history, career, relationships, and inner life. The book offers advice for typical problems. For example, you learn strategies for coping with overarousal, overcoming social discomfort, being in love relationships, managing job challenges, and much more. The author covers a lot of material clearly, in an approachable style, using case studies, self-tests, and exercises to bring the information home. The book is essential for you if you are an HSP--you'll learn a lot about yourself. It's also useful for people in a relationship with an HSP. --Joan Price  ",,0.0,,2009-07-10 20:06:24,,,0,False,,,,0,,c0az9fn,,,,,t3_901zn,,,t1_c0az9fn,,,,t3_901zn,,,,,,,,1425996923.0,,5,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,5,,

Im 23 years old, i live and work with my parents, i am just getting out of a 6 year relationship because i cheated on her it has been already been 3 months since it all ended. I barely eat, im always crying ,barely sleep, i work about 60hours a week and my efforts arent apreciated by anyone. I have already cut myself before and it kind of made me feel better .While driving i have thought of simply pulling the steering wheel to the side so many times. Im distracted and unfocused i have already had two minor accidents simply because im not realizing im swirving

I think of myself as a good person, i tried to start a non profit with my ex and we have already done some projects out of pocket, im always willing to help anyone who asks me, i treat people nicely and normally im very friendly, i am kind of popular because i work alot with people but lately i dont want to see anyone at all except my Ex wich treats me like shit (i dont judge her)

I have always been made feel guilty of everything, all my decisions have always been made to not harm others. Throught the 6years i was with my Ex i fought constantly with my parents because they hated her and wanted an arab girl.On the other side my girl fought alot with me because she wanted more than i could give her as a boyfriend. I was made feel guilty by both sides if i went out i was made feel guilty if i did something with my parents i was made feel guilty 

The detail that haunts me is the fact that my grandfather had a heart attack and died when he had found out that my aunt who had been (lost) had actually escaped to live with a puertorican guy. Honestly i dont want to put my family through that again, i just want them to accept her 

 I cant say im atheist but i barely believe in god. My mother is a religious fanatic when she wants to be and realy manipulative and my father is a person that cant be talked with.

Im unhappy with my work and when i get payed they take my money to ""save it"" wich is bullshit they just hold it so they can keep me trapped  so i dont leave theyre holding about 60K from me, when i want something i have to beg to use my own money, and anytime i ask for it they have this way of talking me down and making me feel guilty

I know there is plenty people having it much worse than i do but i just want out

It's 9:30 PM here. Tonight is again one of those nights where I end up sitting in my room, behind my PC, alone. How do I feel? I don't know. I feel like a mess, I feel frustrated, I feel sad, I feel very, very lonely. 

Being stuck with myself is what makes it worse. I don't like who I am. I'm just the regular quiet guy that not many people get to really know, because I don't want people to know me. I'll just end up hurting them or doing something bad to them, it's better for people not to know me.

In the beginning of December I tried to kill myself. 27 pills weren't enough I discovered the next morning. And my mistake: I told one of my few friends about it. She notified my dad, at 2 AM, my dad read it the morning and got an emergency team on my roof. I failed.

Somewhere between Christmas and New Year's I returned here. Everything was the way it was when I left. And again I just feel like ending it. That's all I can think off. I don't want to live on. I know there's people that care, like my dad, stepmom, family, a few friends. Why can't they accept my wish? Why can't they allow me to do it, if it's the only thing I want? All I kept living for were those people, but now I figured, why would I go through this suffering if I can fix it easily? What is my lifetime of suffering versus their few weeks of suffering after I died? Is this selfish? I start to feel they're the ones being selfish.

I have no idea why. Maybe it's from the painkillers I've been taking, maybe it's related to my constant nauseousness, or maybe its just random chance. I can't get back to sleep anymore so I guess I'll just write, and hope maybe someone wants to write back.

So a few years ago I was laying in my dorm room bed trying to keep my sobbing quiet enough to avoid waking up my roommate. I had no idea what I wanted in life or why I was taking classes for a degree I didn't even want. English, really? I had dreams of being a teacher or a writer or something but taking class after class about how profound Wadsworth and his lame poet friends' were made me realize how much I hate writing and how teaching the same crap, year after year, to kids that don't give a hot fudge sundae would drive me absolutely insane.

So I felt lost. I had no future career path, no friends that didn't require an internet connection to talk to, no intimacy of any kind. I even hated looking at myself in the mirror, although I had no idea why. I thought maybe it was 'cause I was fat. Anyhoo I was super suicidal and blah blah blah I picked myself up and decided to keep on going. At the end of the year I decided to pick a new major and if that one didn't work out I'd quit school and become a gas station attendant. After all they only work like 4 hours and made like 95 simoleons a day in The Sims so how bad could it be?

I looked at the available options for my school and realized that they actually offered a Computer Science program. Huh. Guess I'll try that. People always tell me I'm a nerd so I might as well embrace it. I sign up, get classes picked out, spend the summer working at Walmart, and start back to school in the Fall after quitting my job because Ho Lee crap I am not capable of maintaining a smile for that long. I start learning programming basics and watching other students bang their heads against the wall and why is everyone complaining about how hard this assignment was I thought it was pretty easy and kinda fun actually and oh my god I'm really freaking good at this stuff. I found my calling and I felt super awesome and everything was set for career stuff. So I figure now let's fix my lack of relationships.

I get in touch with old friends and start hanging out with them, and they introduce me to other friends and I start hanging out with them too. Yay, friendship. I try dating but every relationship crashes and burns after a couple months so I do the natural thing and keep trying. Eventually I meet a wonderful girl who broke up with me because I hid the fact I lost my virginity to a guy from her and left me with the sage advice to look inside myself and try to figure out who I really am. So I take her advice and think about who I am and what makes me happy and fuck I just realized I'm transgender. That explains a lot. So I call a place that hands out pills and pay them a visit and vow to start taking care of myself instead of eating Funyuns and playing WoW all day.

I start exercising and eating right and whaddya know estrogen and weight loss made me pretty. Neat. Around that time I graduated from college and started working full-time at the software development place I'd been interning at. I got my own place with a friend of mine that later became more than my friend and things seemed to be going great.

As is want to happen though, life took a turn for the worse. My friend-turned-more-than-friend took a dump on my floor and decided to move back in with her parents two months after I signed the year-long lease. Ugh. My employer started running short on clients so people started being cut and being the newbie I was first to the chopping block. Ugh. I met and briefly dated an awesome girl that helped me forget about my problems but a few weeks after we did it I got really sick and found out she really, really liked having sex with strangers and huh let's see what Wikipedia says oh hey my symptoms are consistent with early stages of HIV. Ugh.

I started losing my mind with worry over the HIV thing but 3 months passed and I was still testing clean so yay I live to die another day. The symptoms never went away though. Weird. I had constant headaches and nausea, my tonsils were swollen and refused to stop hurting, I had that feeling of not being in touch with reality that you get when you're really tired that refused to go away no matter how rested I was. I was a wreck. I felt scared and again I wanted to end myself. And again I said eh screw that and started trying to fix things. I got another programming job that pays well enough to keep making payments on the lease I'm almost done with thank goodness. I try dating but turns out there's not a lot of people interested in dating trannies around here so eh let's try riding this out alone for a while. But the health problems never went away.

I became consumed with worry and felt like garbage all the time and even had my tonsils out but the other symptoms remained. And they've only gotten worse. Now I've started getting feelings of pain and pressure in my lungs that makes me feel like I can't catch my breath and my ears started ringing all the time to the point where I need sound all the time or it drives me to tears. I've tried seeing doctors about it but none of them have a clue or they just want to stick me on fluoxawhatever because I mention the word 'suicide'. I wake up every day and go to a job I'm good at but feel completely uninspired doing in a place I don't want to live and go home every day to an empty house when what I want more than anything is to go home to a nice guy or girl and cuddle up and spend the night watching lame horror movies on Netflix. I have friends and family that care about me but I could care less and I have no idea why and it breaks my heart that I care so little about the people in my life that care the most about me. I'm the loneliest I've ever been and I distract myself with weed and painkillers to avoid the fact that I feel miserable and want to kill myself yet again and honestly don't see a way out this time. I don't think I have the ability to kill myself though, so there's that.

It sounds like the ringing went down a bit so I guess I'll stop rambling now. I really just want to talk to someone that doesn't make me feel like I'm last on their list of things to care about. I know it's stupid and cheesy and I hate myself a little bit just for writing it down but...I want to feel like I matter to someone.

I've been in pretty dark places myself, and despaired that I would never get to fulfill my dream of going to university. I started once, and failed fantastically. I'm still $19k in debt from that. 

I kept working at things, and got the help of a psychiatrist. On the 8th of this month, I attended my first lectures. I'm in university, and I'm making it happen. You cannot imagine how wonderful it is.  

My point is, I'm *not* unique or strange or special. You can do this too. You aren't alone, there is a lot of help available. Things do get better. 

Also: You are more than a uterus with legs. The whole point of being human is to be *more* than just a set of biological functions. ",,0.0,,2011-09-11 09:39:19,,,0,False,,,,0,,c2j12kx,,,,,t3_kbw3m,,,t1_c2j12kx,,,,t3_kbw3m,,,,,,,,1427585492.0,,3,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,3,,

But I do love her more than anything in the world, and she's the only one who understands my feelings (or at least the only one I trust enough). That works Vice Versa as well. We've realized we can't actually maintain a relationship, but are even worse wrecks without each other. So we're trying to be friends, but when the two of us are alone, somehow we end up being in love again. It's kind of witchery to me actually. And I forgot to mention we are in the same school/class, but live 2,5 hours apart. So we also had some sort of long distance thing going on since seeing each other at school was *very flat.*

I'm very afraid of being alone. A year ago, when my first girlfriend (who had a bad influence on me) broke up with me, I stopped school and had no friends. I felt so helpless and worthless, not good to anything at all. I **never** want that to happen again, and I **never** want to end up being alone again.

I don't want to end it all, sometimes I feel like there's nothing else to do. That's why I'm scared of it, and myself.

Only recently has it returned and I've realized how desperate my situation is. During these two years I've survived off of a small inheritance and working retail. The latter has been a constant for many years now and is beginning to drive me insane. Although I have a good education it's basically worthless without a Masters I can't afford or want. Since graduating I've sent in 1000 resumes and used up nearly all my options and gotten nowhere. I am renting an apartment with my girlfriend that, after all expenses, leaves me with nothing now. She has been very supportive emotionally but has few answers (not that I expect any) and is doing well with her career. She knows my situation but my depression and unhappiness are definitely weighing on her now. I am unable to move 'back home' like some people I know. 

I feel like a shell of myself and know my options are few to survive and get where I want. It's been very tough and I know I will either be stuck here or wind up homeless. I feel like nothing will work out and no one can help. Life is unfair and I accept that. I do work hard and have but nothing works out. Most others I know have a better family situation to fall back on or their lives are beginning to take off financially where as I'm left behind for no real good reason outside of making some mistakes in my choice of education unknowingly.

18457,,True,DontKnowWhatToDoDude,,,,"Sorry for being a little confusing, my brain is spinning a million miles an hour.

Her grandparents are the source of money for the family. They are worth millions at least from what I can tell. They have helped her our very little in finances for school. They did however spend well over 20k on dresses, makeup, hair stuff, etc... They want her to work full-time, go to school full-time, and do pageants.

The only way they will continue to support is to do pageants. I think on some level she does enjoy them and it is good scholarship money, but it is a huge stress on everyone. I basically lose her for a year. I feel like they are another way for her family to control her. When her therapist and psychiatrist are trying to get her to distance herself.

She is thinking of my feelings, her own feelings, and weighing her family's feelings.

However, to give you a small background on her family. When she was raped at 14 it was when she lost her virginity. She was raped by a 16 year old boy who her mom invited him and his mom to live with them. Her family claims that she wasn't really ""raped"", that she just didn't know that's what women were suppose to do and didn't know that she could say no. She was begging and crying during the rape. She didn't know what to do afterwards and it happened over and over.

I feel she is in a tricky situation. Trying to balance everyone's feelings, but I feel if she does pageants, she is just allowing her family to assert their control over her. Even if she wants to do them. Something her care team wants her to get away from (the control, not necessarily the pageants). On the other hand, it's super hard on our relationship, she is stressed and gone all the time. Thus, I am stressed. However, she has met a few great friends and has gotten a lot of scholarship money. The funny side is she can't really go to school while she does pageants because of the commitment.

I mostly understand most sides of it. I just don't want to go through that stress again. I don't feel I can take it again and it feels that her wanting to them that badly means on some level she doesn't care about my feelings. I know that isn't necessarily true, but that's how it makes me feel.

The important part is, I want to be with her. She is everything to me.

 I am bi polar and going through something NO ONE ever should have to go through.

 My 3 year old son is terminal, I have some desions to make that I dont know the answers too, and its so so hard. He needs surgery that constists of brain, brain stem, and spinal cord, and skull surgery. The worst part of it all, his survival rate is at about 5% , BUT if I dont do it, he can live a few more years but will just fall one day to the ground to never breath again, everyday I pray is not that day. Do you know how scary it is to watch your child and wonder what you are going to do when that happens, will he be in my arms?, will he be playing?, will he be asleep, and the worst one of my fears, will I be alone when it happens? That one right there I am sooooo terrified of, I have a fiance but he is always at work, we have alot of bills and alot of responisblity for my son that normal people dont. I dont know how to write, I have never been good at this, I am sorry I am just trying to explain this as best I can. My son has already had skull surgery at 3 mo old, we almost lost him when he was born, AND during that surgery. He has alot of different medical problems too, He has 3 ASD's of the heart ( he needs surgery for that too) , absent left kidney that the tubes are narrowing on, closed hole spinal bifida, fluid pocket on his spine that is growing, craniostensenosis ( sp? I can never spell it right) they are pretty sure he is autistic, failure to thrive, cleft palate , recessed jaw, along with the closing around his brain stem, the brain stem is coming detached from the brain and spinal cord, and he is missing 4 vertebrae on his spine, and it is narrowing . There are MANY surgeries he needs, the odds are so against him. I am scared shitless, and I dont know what to do, I have no friends or family to speak of, and I feel so alone. I have to make this decision of to get the surgery done, or let him live for how ever long he can, and just let him go, I am afraid , because this surgery he MIGHT make it out of, and that part be over, and can go on and get his heart fixed, his mouth, everything that is wrong with him, or I can just let him go. He has a chance of better odds of making through the surgery, but that isnt attainable as of right now, we would have to move to another state, have people be there for us, and my daughter, we dont have the money, resources, place to stay, any of it! I have tried almost everything I can think of to get some funding to help save my son's life, he needs to get to The Mayo Clinic in Mnn. They have a better survival rate for this surgery, his chances go to around 45% IF we can get him there. Im just so lost, every avenue I have tried has failed , people JUST DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY SON, no one, he has fallen through the cracks and because I am a shitty mother, I am NO BODY, my son has to suffer the consequences. Everyday I wonder , did I do this to my son? Did he come out this way because of my health and body? I would like to also mention he was never supposed to happen, I was never supposed to be able to get pregnant again, I actually found out I was pregnant with him , after I had blood drawn for pre-op for a hysterectomy .  We have been through so many  genetics testings , they can find NO REASON he was born this way

 Now to the other part of the story, ME, I am diagnosed Bi-Polar , I have aggressive MS, fibro, loss of function of my muscles and nerves ( my mylan is deteriorating ), as many more smaller things wrong with me ,  as of right now I have no mylan around my knees and part of my legs , if there is no mylan, my nerve surges shoot all through out my body, and into muscles or my bones, its EXTREMELY painful.  I even fought off death when my daughter was born, I was in the hospital for 3 months after I had her, I had a severe staff infection that spread through my whole body, some of my organs were shutting down. I made it though, I love my children with everything that is ME! They are my world, if not for them, I wouldnt breath, move , or exist. This March I was told I have about 15 yrs at best, if my health keeps deteriorating , I have been on so many different meds I cant even remember the names of half of them, nothing has slowed it down :( My fiance didnt realize how severe I was, he has always been a wonderful man, taken care of me, been by my side, he is just one man though. He doesnt know all the answers, never shares his feelings, and never tries to put more on me than what already is. We had a huge fight about a month ago, he hasnt been the nicest the past about 8 months, lashing out on me, our kids, and EVERYONE. I asked him what did I do to deserve this? I dont want to live the rest of my life like this, I dont have as long as he does to enjoy life, and the way it looks I will be running my self ragged trying to save my son. All in the end my family will still be losing one of us, or both.  He looks at me and says "" I am sorry I am being this way, I dont know how to control it, I am mad, confused and hurt"", I ask why?  he says "" Do you not see I look at your beautiful face every single day, and wonder what have I done for god to take away everything that means the world to me? He is taking my son, and if that isnt enough, my wife, my soul mate. He says I am scared Dana, I dont want to lose either of you. I am going to be left alone with two huge wholes in my heart and voids in my life, how are me and Skylar supposed to deal with this? I just looked at him, and cried so hard,  I am going to be in a wheel chair full time soon , I am in one now but I am determined to NOT be in it, I wont stay in that damn chair until I fall for the last time, and cant get the fuck back up, god damn it I am 28 years old, this isnt right! 

I so want to go before my son does, so I can be there waiting for him so he isnt scared,  I would rather Skylar not see the worst of what is to come, I dont want to disappoint and watch my best friend ( my fiance ) and my daughter , I cant bare to  think of what this is going to do to them, when I get so bad I am in the hospital, and cant be a mom, or a wife. I know I am rambling, I dont know how to clearly say what I am feeling. I just know , that if I am going to die anyways, I want to be there before my son does, I am a waste of space here, and nothing but a burden on my family.  I have given up on my self, I need my son to get better.  I am falling apart on the outside and inside. I am medicated with lithium ( 1000mg's) a day and have been on almost everything imaginable for this depression. I wish I had a choice to better my life, in my circumstances there is nothing  I can do to change the fact my son is dying, and so am I. Our whole family is falling apart, and angry at each other, I feel like I am letting my fiance down, we are supposed to grow old together! And watch both of our children grow up and be loving good people ,My daughter is also having a VERY hard time with this, she has been there for EVERYTHING, even when they sat us down to tell us he is terminal. They never thought to take her out of the room BEFORE telling us, she lost it, I have let her down, Thank you. I just need to get this off of my chest, I have no one to talk to , when I try to talk about my son dying or me , my fiance just sits there with this look in his eye, and says everything will be ok.. we will figure out a way to make it all ok, we always do. What I dont tell him, is that all I want to do is just get it over with  and die. That I hurt so bad, that cooking his dinner takes almost every single amount of strength I have in me, I TRY not to tell him things that really hurts me or just takes everything out of me, he is exhausted to, exhausted isnt even a powerful enough word for what me and him are, we havent had a full nights sleep since my daughter was born,and as my son's brain condition gets worse, the less he sleeps because of pain, and brain pressure, I am lucky to get 3 hours of scattered sleep every night, same with him, no one cares we are so tired, we have hallucinated , we cant function, We have had people say damn you look like shit, you need some sleep,  and they know we have NO ONE, not one person to watch the kids, to let us sleep, to keep Skylar while we are 4 hours away at Children's with our son, we are in so much trouble right now because of truancy its not funny. I have to make the decision of taking the only normalcy my daughter has ( school ) out of her life, and keep her home for homeschooling. That decision is as hard as me making the decision for my son. She doesnt have any friends, and gets made fun of constantly, but she loves to go to school and learn. Im just a fuck up that cant get anything right, even making healthy children. What did I do or better yet, my children do to deserve this?

We can't think quickly enough to save people like that. It's just not possible. You couldn't have failed there because you couldn't have won, either.

I'm glad you're here because I care about your story and your struggle. I see myself in it. I want so badly for you to get through this because I've been on both sides of it. I've been the one puking after a suicide attempt, and I've also been the girlfriend trying to save someone I loved. You see, because of the severity of my depression, I sought out partners who also suffered from it so we could relate to each other. Two of my boyfriends (one is now my husband) have attempted suicide.  I sat with them for hours and hours on end, sometimes days, until they felt better. My husband (before we married) had nearly sliced his neck open with a butcher knife at one point, and has been hospitalized numerous times.

I can tell that your girlfriend loved you with ever fiber of her being. If she could see you now, and how you blame yourself, it would just tear her apart. The kind of love she felt for you is completely unconditional, and that's why you shouldn't kill yourself. She tried so hard to save you last time.

50098,,False,kay_rod,,,,"I'm glad you reached out. It sounds like you're in a pretty tough situation. It also sound like it's something that, with a little support, can be worked through.      
    
I think tapping into your friends for help moving and packing is definitely the first step. If you can get done the part you're able to physically handle by the method /u/futureabnormal mentioned (setting aside dedicated chunks of time to work on it - hell, turn on some music and make it a party!), even a small group should be able to knock it out fast. Offer to feed them homemade muffins or cookies, or order a pizza and grab some beers. If you're friends aren't able, you can always find guys on Craigslist looking to make $25 and eat free food.     
    
The $100 increase in rent sucks but, again, it's manageable. As has been previously suggested, sell as much stuff as you can on Craigslist or Ebay. There are 2 upsides to that - less stuff to pack and move AND more money in your pocket. I would say that if you haven't used it in the past 3 months, you can part with it and be okay. Once your settled in your new place, consider offering up your couch on AirBNB. Price it cheaply enough to be competitive and make sure to take nice pictures - it will help bring in the extra cash you need to cover rent. If you need it, you can always ask for help on /r/assistance.     
    
Finally, as terrible as your experience at the hospital was, I'd recommend seeing a counselor if your insurance will cover it (if not, check with local agencies to see what they have available). A lot of folks dealing with invisible illnesses like RA benefit from having someone to talk to (I've worked a lot with kids with Chrons Disease, and a huge number of them struggled with depression). It's a hard disease to deal with on your own.

3546,,True,[deleted],,,,"It's 4am here too! So I'm just going to touch on the school issue because it's the part that struck me most, because I've been through it.

I've been at my community college for like...5 years, 2 of which were in high school (they had a program there for kids who got kicked out of/hated their original high school...it was the latter for me). I stayed for a year after graduating and then got hit so hard with depression/OCD that I just stopped going. I've dealt with this shit for years but it was the worst then that it ever had been. After a few months of getting myself together (which is allowed, by the way! NEVER deny yourself time to heal) I got a job. I kind of sucked at the job and was still miserable, but it got me out of the house and I earned some money. After 9 months I quit and went back to school. By this point I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to study and the desperation I felt about being so far behind (compared with the rest of my friends) eventually caused me to get my shit together. I'm now in my second to last quarter at this school and I applied to 6 UCs a few months ago. I'm feeling pretty optimistic.

The point of me bringing myself up- what I learned is that failure can fuel you to do well, if you let it. I spent so long feeling stuck in a rut because I wasn't thinking about it properly. I was letting it drag me down instead of inspire me.

My advice to you (this is school related only, for now) is to realize that it is NEVER too late. Education is something you do for yourself. If your parents are paying for school it might make you feel pressured, but in the end you are doing this for yourself. Discover what you want and DON'T give up no matter how many times you fail a class or start to feel stuck. This kind of shit takes time. Learn to love delayed gratification, it will pay off in the end (I know it doesn't feel true, but trust me it is).

I want to say good luck but I don't think luck is what you need. I think you are very capable of doing this yourself. I don't mean this in a ""suck it up"" kind of way, I just mean that I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit; I don't think you realize your own potential.",,0.0,,2009-01-24 12:02:09,,,0,True,,,,0,,c078txi,,,,,t3_7s35u,,,t1_c078txi,,,,t1_c078t25,,,,,,,,1425916196.0,,6,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,6,,

It sounds like you need a break, yes. Relief and relaxation would be great things but they are feelings and you must be alive to feel. What you're alluding to doing isn't either, it's the end. You can't enjoy a reprieve if you're not here. Try not to look at suicide as the answer, it will bring no peace.

As far as the other things, I understand a lot of them. I too was painfully shy growing up, ostracized and hated by my father's family, worked horrible jobs and dealt with the loneliness of having no friends. I really do understand a lot of where you are coming from. I can explain this because I lived through it. There have been times when I felt like exiting stage left, but things do improve with time. It may take years for it all to work out, but you're not going to be on the bottom forever. 

The family thing sucks, but there is little you can do to fix it. You have to come to the realization like I did that though you may have common blood you don't have to base your worth on their opinions. It is impossible to please everyone. So, the best you can do is accept that you are better than they think, better than they are and better off without them. It's hard, but goddamn, it feels good to believe it.

Friends will come in time as well. People are going to be constantly coming and going in and out of your life for the rest of your life. The trick to the incoming is to learn how to best filter out the trash so that you can focus on and enjoy interaction with the treasure. The trick about outgoing is to let go of any negativity as it is just emotional baggage, and focus on the good times and life lessons learned. 

As for the job, you must work to live, not live to work. Think of your current job as a means to an end while you look for something better. There are better jobs out there despite what the media says or you may fear, but you must earnestly try to find them. Don't give up the search, and do not give up on your current job. You may hate it, but any work is good work for the time being.

I don't mean to sound curt, but if you're anything like me, sometimes all I need is a deft kick in the ass to get moving. I'd be happy to accommodate anytime. Consider me a friend.

What those bullies have done is horrible. It's terrible that things have been allowed to progress to this point. I know you know this, but you don’t deserve to feel bad on those people’s behalf. (Some of those things aren’t even insults!)
I understand that self-harming may provide you with the release and sense of control needed to face the world? I also totally get that it’s your body and what you do with it is your choice.  
I would very much like you to consider talking to a school councillor or your doctor about these issues, although this might seem scary. This is not just for you, but also for the sake of Austin, who clearly cares for you very deeply. 
I’m going to suggest some practical things, but these are just suggestions and ideas for you to consider: You could take a photo of your locker next time these things happen and show it to the principle. There are laws against schools allowing this kind of behaviour and they will be compelled to help you. The next time you want to self-harm you could use a red felt tip pen instead of a knife. You could also try doing push-ups until you can’t move your arms any more. (This both work surprisingly well.)
Most importantly, you are not alone. I know that there are people who are trying to make you feel different and even sub-human, but you’re not alone. Everyone who reads your post is rooting for you and wants the very best for you. You’ve been incredibly brave to have managed this well for this long.

That's awful your relationship with your parents  is like that right now. When you can't find support from your parents, it's hard to feel supported at all. Beyond that, it makes you feel like there is something wrong with you inherently. When my parents disapprove of who I am, it used to make me feel like I wasn't good. I would try to be perfect, when in reality I wasn't. No one is. But that quality about you isn't flawed. It just takes time to realize that and understand that. As times moves on, and you grow older, it becomes easier to understand who you are. You accept yourself, and that makes you happy.

I wonder if I've ever run into this kid before. He plays UT2004 instagib CTF, or used to, for this clan that used the tag ]MM[ or something.

I lost my job and I don't have enough money to survive to pay rent and food. Now I'm living with my parents, staring at the ceiling having suicidal thoughts. I would like not to blame my brother for this but it effected me so much and I know I should have blame for my own actions. 

The point is I don't want to end up like my brother and have my family break tears again. It will be selfish of me and I would not want to bring a chain reaction to my family. Whatever leftover I have in my bank account from my employment insurance went towards to the gym and which I did bodybuilding, it really helped me from my depressions. I was always a skinny kid so I did my research about it. In 8 months I went from 130lbs to 175lbs with alot of lean muscles. I still do feel suicidal but not as much as before. I recently apply for welfare and I hope I get accepted because I'm also running out of money from my employment inssurance. So hold on tight and do something that makes you happy as I am right now.

10632,,True,SW_Michael,,,,"That ""pointlessness"" is certainly the biggest hurdle ever. I think I know what you're talking about. I have to make an extra effort every day to be social. I have zero friends at this point. It's been seven years since my attempt, and I'm a dad now. That sort of helps keep me out of trouble because the guilt of leaving my family balances out my suicidial-ness. But it's still unbelievably tough to be interested in random stranger/holiday-gathering conversations that I don't particularly want to be involved in: advice on raising kids; where to get better deals on tvs; whose ""I got pulled over"" story is most compelling. Blah. 

I always thought all of this had to be fake - like my very own Truman Show. Because I see the stage. I see the actors. They're all reading their lines. But am I the only one who wants to stop the play? It's just the routines of life, I suppose. But you know what? You don't necessarily have to get sucked into that system. I'm assuming you don't have kids, which helps give you some wiggle room to explore some options. 

I mean, if you ever feel up to it, why not just take a long trip to somewhere isolated.. alone if you can. You are constantly surrounded by the very things that bring you down. And through the wonders of technology, you are also constantly reminded one way or another. Just make a spontaneous decision to get up and leave. And I dont mean go to the next state over. I mean, really go someplace completely different: different culture; different scenery; different lifestyle. If you have the money, why not try a different country altogether? During my lowest point, I packed my car and drove 900 miles to go back to school. I literally threw myself into a fire I knew nothing about. Nothing was planned, I just said fuckit, what else is left? It helped to some degree. So if you're able to just close your eyes and shut off your mind for a split second, make that leap into uncomfortable territory. That time off may change your perspectives for the better.",,0.0,,2011-05-11 05:03:26,,,0,False,,,,0,,c1tg6dp,,,,,t3_h840a,,,t1_c1tg6dp,,,,t1_c1tfe6h,,,,,,,,1427136810.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

I think I'm suicidal but I don't think I'd have the drive to go through with it. I know people care about me and I know it'd make people upset if I was no longer here.

For the longest time, I've been depressed. I've been depressed since 2007. I was 14 then. I'm 21 now. I was with some girl in my first relationship, thought she was amazing and then she left me for my best friend. I know, it might be a hard pill to swallow for some but I guess you could say I took it bad. We were only together for 3 months but I would cry everyday for hours and not have any motivation to do anything, it was sad.

One morning, I felt this urge and I couldn't really describe it other than me not wanting to be here anymore. I wasn't violent or aggressive in that urge but I just thought ""I should probably just kill myself."" Went to the doctor and he told me I had affective disorder. I was like fuck, I thought of depression as a bad thing as most people would but then I would just think there's some massive stigma around it and people would just think you're just faking it and you don't have it that bad.

Before I got diagnosed, my mum thought I was lazy and well, my whole family thought I was lazy because I didn't want to get out of bed and face the day. It was weird because, I would usually feel energetic and stuff but I just felt like I had no purpose or meaning and nothing I did mattered, in the end.

I dropped out of college 3 times because of my depression and my motivation was non-existent. I didn't wanna do any of my work and I was really closed off when it came to making new friends and stuff. I have friends now and I'm open and positive around them and they're relatively understanding but I've never told them I wanted to commit suicide. 

My ex-girlfriend from last year would cut herself and I didn't really wanna be around that. I cared but I had my own problems to attend to. I didn't really want someone who would cut herself when I didn't talk to her so I broke up with her and then she cut herself more than she ever did. I didn't really feel any emotion from her cutting herself because in the end, it was more than I could deal with and I had no grounds to help her anyway. She needed professional help.

A few weeks ago, my mum got diagnosed with cancer. Lung cancer. Not from smoking, either. From Asbestos. It only affects 1% of the population or something.
It's early days yet but I've been thinking. If she goes, I go too. I don't really have a family member to fall back on. My two brothers who I live with still call me lazy, disgusting and they're not supportive, I guess.

My dad is a drug addict and an alcoholic and I guess my uncles, who I'm sort of close to, I guess. One is a drug addict and one wealthy and is supportive of me (financially) but he just thinks I'm lazy and that I'm leeching off the government.

With my mum having cancer, she can get something called Carer's Allowance. I told her, if she wants, she can put me down as her carer and she can have the money that the government gives me. She needs the money more than I do. My brother told my wealthy uncle that I basically told my mum that I wanna get money and that I'm going to do nothing to help her. He's generally protective of my mum and called me disgusting and lazy.

Didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't true but in the end, there's no convincing some people.

I haven't had a job and people might be like ""What the fuck, you're 21 and you don't have a job. I've been working since I was 14."" and I can sort of understand but I went straight from high school to college and did some years of college and didn't like it. I went to find a job and I told my job assistant that I was suicidal and she told me to go to the doctor. I don't think my anxiety helps either. Some people might say ""you should just take anything you can get, the economy is hard"" etc. It is. You can't choose what job you want but I guess I want some satisfaction out of it. It can be hard when you don't have very many qualifications too.

I'm just rambling on now. I'm sorry but I just wanted somewhere to vent. It's really hard for me and it's hard to see through text but I just feel like crying. Sorry for the wall of text.

Thanks for reading, if you have.

In my own life there have been times where I've felt genuinely well regarded or well liked but I don't ever really feel part of that community. There's a separateness there that I don't fully understand. I have learned, over time, that my self worth doesn't have to be so tied up in other people. That doesn't always, however, make it feel any better to be on the other side of the wall, so to speak. Full disclosure though, I do and almost always have been able to maintain one close relationship at a time, I can't say I've ever truly been friendless so I can only imagine what that is really like.

I personally don't think there is a point. Most of the time I'm okay with that. Sometimes I think about how short a human lifetime is and it does feel like there isn't much difference between dying now and dying later. Life can feel futile. However, and this could be because I am a bit focused upon myself in general, I find myself living for good experiences. I don't really mean the grand experiences people talk about; the epic trips to strange places, the epiphanies, and so on. Just the good times. Doing things I genuinely like. Of course, when people are depressed, it can be really difficult to really enjoy things. I think it would be disingenuous if I declared that this is something that should or would work in your own life. My overall point is that there are other things that some people do live for, not just the mainstream ideals that we grow up thinking we need to strive for. I can't say if you will find your own point to life.

I do hope you can feel better. I hope your next therapist is a better fit or results in some kind of relief. ",,0.0,,2014-11-04 06:13:37,,,0,False,,,,0,,clsgcqo,,,,,t3_2l86ve,,,t1_clsgcqo,,,,t3_2l86ve,,,,,,,,1426201236.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

NAVEL-GAZING FOLLOWS

I used to think I was really smart and clever, which exacerbated my extreme cynicism. Now I can only look at the big picture and it makes me so sure this life is just unending struggle without reward. I don't find the struggle fulfilling. Nothing makes me want to meet the challenge. My blip of consciousness is so brief that prolonging my lifespan, and my pain, by not committing suicide seems like the stupid choice. 

Yes, others in my life would experience pain when I died, but grief becomes a part of you, and it's sort of understood that people in your life will die. That's what we all sign up for every day we continue to live. People will find a rationalization that works for them and gradually move on.

The shitty part is the note. Because if I truly explain myself in a note, the people I leave behind will know I think all of their lives are worthless too. Individually, they are. If I had more faith in humanity I would consider sticking around for some things that humanity as a whole can accomplish, but right now it's still the dark ages. If I were brilliant and talented, maybe I could do something about this, but I can't, and neither can anyone I know.

Now how is it that I can justify my selfish behavior and condemn everyone's lives to oblivion? It's all because I'm lazy and disappointed with myself and wishing I was a different species because self-awareness sucks. And disappointed with the whole goddamned world.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't know what I expect SW to do with this post, I'm just getting pretty nihilistic I suppose. I'm at this really calm state, it's like double-checking your pockets before you leave the house. Considering my own irrationality, it's likely that no one will be able to convince me of anything that will change my mind. But it would be nice to be wrong, to feel something click inside me that says ""if you don't try, things that are actually bad will happen.""

And yes, there's all kinds of problems going on in the ""small picture"" too. I have been depressed/anxious for 16 years, have a history of alcohol abuse, my mother killed herself when I was 10, no parental figure of note after that, in deep debt, worthless college degree, no job, completely entirely broke except for pocket change, about to get kicked out of my place. Just to be clear, I've had suicidal ideation for years, which comes and goes in intensity. 

Thanks for reading. I welcome any insight.

She's angry with me for something in the past, which honestly, looking back, I'd not have come clean about it months ago if I knew that two months after the fact, she'd become angry about it. I was elated when she didn't leave me and thought things would work themselves out. She wasn't mad at first. Now, she won't even speak to me except here and there. The uncertainty just makes everything worse. It also comes at the worst time. I thought she'd be proud of me finally coming out to my family as transgender (female to male), but instead, it was something that she seemed to not even care that I did. Now, I just regret it. I told them about her (they honestly thought I would never date anyone) as well. Now, I get to deal with their judgmental looks with no support. 

My life has been pretty shitty and I don't think it'll improve. I felt my entire life that no one would actually love me and that I'd be alone.

It also seems like you're limiting yourself in what you apply to and that your main goal is finding something long term that you will enjoy. But given the state of the economy maybe just finding something in the interim to pay the bills and give you some spending cash is what you need to focus on. As mentioned in a comment below apply to anything and everything on craigslist, look for a waiting job, job at a fast food joint.

These jobs may not be something to write home about but it will cover your basic monetary needs and squelch all the worrying about bills, food, and a place to live. Having those basic necessities covered will give you a moral boost and lead to less stress.

After doing so consider looking to different cities for employment. Save what you can and look to move elsewhere, a fresh start somewhere new might be just what you need. The northern Virginia and DC Metro area is a great area to find employment.

103590,,True,[deleted],,,,"First of all, I want you to know that I have nothing by the upmost respect and admiration for you as a vet and as a trans individual. Second of all, I know you are in a lot of pain and torment. I want to say I understand, but we both know I dont and never will because I am not trans and i am not in the armed forces. I do have love and compassion in my heart for you, and I don't even know you. So I hope that counts for something.

There was a study a few years back, I wish I could find the link for it, but the study found that people can pretty much overcome any emotional trial within about 3 months to a year with the exception of something horribly traumatic, such as death. There was a man who was falsely imprisoned for 30 years before being exonerated by a DNA test. Know what he said when he got out? He said it was the best experience of his life.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that many decisions we have to make are tough, but often deliberating over them is what hurts us. What does your wife love about you? Your courage? Your sense of humor or humility? About half of the people on this planet are male-bodied, so there must have been something special about you that made her want to marry you. That doesn't change just because your physical body changes! 

I believe that you have been suffering for a long time, and even though I don't know what it's like to be trans, I do understand the feeling of being trapped living a life you don't feel comfortable with. I want you to be happy, and I want you to be well, and I want you to be free. I implore you to talk to your wife about how you are feeling. 

You deserve to be happy, especially after the sacrifice you have given for your country. I wish you the best.

For me, it seems unconscionable for a person to be convicted of a felony (which basically ruins your life - you can no longer vote, forget about ever getting a decent job, as well as never being allowed to get an apt, carry a gun/knife - even to hunt with) for telling someone they should ""just go off and die somewhere"" or ""kill yourself"" in a moment of anger...

I used to be able to string together the most beautiful sentences...now, now I struggle just to get my point across. 

I wish I could say how I feel, how much this hurts. I wish I hadn't pushed away all of the people who were once there for me, as I really need them now. I don't blame them though, I understand how frustrating it is for them. To continually try to help someone who won't help themselves is exhausting I'd imagine. 

The worst part is I don't want to get better. Well, that's not entirely true. I don't want to have to go through the process to get well. The guilt and shame associated with asking for help is too much for me to endure right now. Telling a stranger that you want to kill yourself is...well...it is daunting to say the least. I really can't stand being locked up in a hospital, and every time I end up in one, I tell myself immediately it was a mistake admitting my thoughts, and that I should have just kept silent or carried out my plan. There is always a plan. 

After sitting here for a while, I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. I'll receive the typical replies, ""call a helpline"" and ""talk to someone"", I appreciate the sentiment and it's lovely that you care enough to respond...but no. I guess just writing this is enough to keep me grounded for one day. 

I can't remember the last time I concentrated this long, so that's a plus. I know it's just a matter of time though. 

I used to have a list of things I would want to do before I carry out my plan. Eat a luxurious meal. Experience things I had always wanted but never had. Spend time with people I cared about. Now I just feel like I'm biding time. Waiting for the right moment. That moment when courage and opportunity align. 

I feel so scattered. Thought loops. I am broken. I've been so angry lately, furious even. Screaming in fits of rage over the littlest annoyances. I feel like I will soon turn that anger inwards.

I'm just curious...what's your reasoning for why it's getting bad? We might agree but have different reasons. For me, it's because it seems to be getting more melodramatic...the first 3 seasons reminded me of The Wire set in Westeros (another great show btw), but season 4 reminded me more of a conventional TV show.

Although I haven't been diagnosed with bi-polar I have been prescribed the required medications for the condition. I don't take them anymore, and I feel just fine. I've been working on the agoraphobia too. It basically no longer a problem for me anymore. For me it was based off childhood trauma which I've been dealing with on my own. Can't really say what would work for you, but I had to just force myself out a bit at a time until I got comfortable. It was scary as shit as first, but i'm fairly confident I could go just about anywhere I want now. Baby steps is the best advice I could give. I understand how frustrating it can be trust me. It was all fear based for me, I had to conquer the fear a little bit at a time. 

As for the bi-polar, I had to keep my mood up and discover what my triggers were. Once I knew that, I could reorganize my thoughts and keep centered. It's more complex than that, but that's the simplified version. Keep things as positive as you can, if your dark thoughts start creeping up, acknowledge them, then return to a positive thought. Practice as often as you can. Clean up your diet and excercise atleast 30 minutes a day. Do hobbies you enjoy, like reading, or video games. Anything you can to take your mind off your problems.

I knew someone in high school named Jordan. At that time, they were a male as far as anyone knew... but then, little by little, ""he"" started to change. ""He"" was 18 at the time and taunted relentlessly for wearing make-up, growing his hair, wearing skirts and trying to use the female toilets. But Jordan is now 20 and a beautiful young woman. She has long blonde hair, a slender but shapely body and beautiful smile... the kind of smile you never saw on ""his"" face in high school. I know that as hard as it was for Jordan to change her entire world, move away from those who wouldn't support her to protect her identity (they were threatening to expose her to every guy she met so she would be alone forever), undergo very serious surgeries, retrain herself to do ""girl"" things like styling her hair, everything she went through to get where she is today was worth it, because she finally found her happiness.

My previous job was making my symptoms a lot worse. I was being targeted by staff for harassment and false accusations and it became overwhelming. I had plans to kill myself, instead I quit my job.

Since then I've been having a pretty nice time tbh. I feel like a person for the first time in memory. The only problem is that I can't find another job, and I don't qualify for any benefits. I am applying for every vacancy there is, but I don't have a lot of skills or experience in very much at all. I'm just keeping going with it, and I have two weeks to secure another job in order to pay rent, bills and eat. Anything after that and I will be homeless with nothing to my name. 

I have sold everything I can, I have no family to help me out and my friends have already helped me as much as they can. I have tried to sell my body as sort of a last resort but I can't figure out how to go about it in a way that isn't making it a publicly known thing. 

I've been having a nice time since I quit my job, I'm just really disappointed that it will have to end. I can't face the prospect of having literally nothing, I won't be able to build myself back up from that. I guess I just wasn't meant to get on well in life. Like I said, I had a really bad past, so these past few weeks have been a good note to end on.

I know this might seem a bit of an insignificant reason to kill myself, but unless work comes up then I have no way of continuing to live. I'm going to continue looking for work and if I'm really lucky I'll get something, but I've accepted that this is probably the end of the line for me. I can't tell my friends of my plans, and I guess I just need to know that somebody else knows how I feel and what I plan. It has felt quite strange typing all of this out.

There's a couple things that I'm just not up for dealing with:

* formally quitting my job

* cancelling my new lease that's about to start

but I figure my last steps: 

* informing my family of financial info so that they can finish my affairs and have the leftovers

* telling a ""friend"" who lives close-by that can probably take short-term care of the pets

will handle it.  Unfortunately, I can't do anything more certain than ""hoping"" my friends or family will be able to care for the pets since it would set in motion the ticking time bomb for me to actually off myself before the cops come and etc.

I've also been binge-eating the past few days. I feel sick, but as someone who's been weight-conscious, it was basically the only ""deathwish"" I could think of.

I woke up today feeling I could kind of go either way, suicide or living, but I've missed enough work to have ""abandoned employment"" (I had been warned before after my last suicide phase), so I don't have a job to go back to -- and after binge-eating, I've gained a few pounds (I had been trying unsuccessfully to lose weight before, so this would be even harder to get to a happy state).

Basically I went to Belgrade with my parents where we were informed that I'm not entitled to even an examination and let alone being admitted there. Apparently my psychiatrist from Jagodina* (that's the city next to me, I'm in Cuprija.**) fucked something up. So basically we just went back home.

On the way, we checked with my psychiatrist and she gave me three new drugs without explaining anything about them. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine Mirthazipine, known to cause weight gain and hallucinations.

Some anti-psychotic whose name I don't remember and Lorazepam (Ativan). I taken Lorazepam the night before and it got me high and I had hallucinations.

I'm not planing on taking any of these drugs. Especially since it's been only a week since I stopped Zoloft.

They want to commit me now in Jagodina though, but there's not room so I'll have to wait until Wednesday. I see no point in this. If I was being committed on the fear I might harm myself waiting all this time is stupid.

I feel though like my life fell apart now. I don't want to kill myself, but I wish I could just go somewhere and never come back. It seems like no matter what I try it only turns worse.

My plan now is to wait a few days that the things settle and then steal some of my dad's saving money, buy a bus ticket and never come back. He'd spend that money on my therapy anyway, and when I get a job I'll pay him back.

i'm glad, at least, that you're choosing to wait for a long time. this gives your brain time to heal and change.

nevertheless, what you described does sound depression-y, and i would tell a doctor about it. no one is going to lock you up (that doesn't happen unless you are going to do it right now and you have a way to do it.) 

depression doesn't have to be 'i am overridden with despair, ah'. it sometimes shows up as 'uh. everything is crap. and basically meaningless. and so am i. welp...' 

if you're not enjoying anything in your life and don't have hope for the future, that's cause to tell a doctor, especially if 'well, i should kill myself' is in there.

Fuck the American education system. Everything is impersonal ""go to college"" bullshit. Nobody actually gives a shit about anything, and all my ""friends"" think I'm lying an exaggerating when I'm unable to go to school for reasons I will detail shortly. I've been dealing with extreme depression and anxiety for...6 years now? It's extremely obvious, everyone gives me shit about it, but every time I try to talk to any authority they look the other way. Doctors keep wanting to try another thing without meds like my life is a fucking game they get a hiscore in if they don't use prescriptions.

The only girl who ever helped me escape any of this, the only person who has ever expressed any love towards me, romantic or otherwise, broke up with me a few weeks ago, two months before our third year together (I'm not even going to begin going into how much I loved her and how much I was willing to do for her, along with how much I thought she loved me, but we had been long distance and she was slowly pushing me away because she said she felt depressed (over the course of a few months), then wanted a break and finally ended it by telling me she was happier when I didn't talk to her. Heartbreak doesn't even begin to cut it) and a few days before I got my wisdom teeth out. A surgery that I was absolutely terrified by, and rightly so, because it seems they were fucking lying when they said you don't feel or remember anything when you're on nitrous. I remember and felt everything, plus some extra hallucinations that made the experience all the more worse. I fucking knew I should have forced them to let me use general anesthesia because I'm terrified of bring conscious but not in full control of myself...leading into:

Schizophrenia apparently runs in my family. Half the time my mind makes up random shit and I can't tell if it's intuition or craziness. I haven't heard voices, but I feel like there are sometimes multiple consciences inside me telling me different things. Occasionally when I daydream I can get completely lost in it and it can become nightmarish. Sometimes I have dreams that string together in a series of events over a course of time and I have to convince myself I'm not in a dream world.

On top of that, I'm very much a hypochondriac, which makes it difficult to figure out what the hell I should do when I'm constantly in pain, extremely nauseous, and, for all intents and purposes, have the symptoms of a textbook case of MS (which I'm luckily not currently having any trouble with, but maybe that's just the painkillers talking) and nobody takes me seriously. Again this all ties back to me not quite knowing what's reality and what's my brain doing whatever the fuck it wants.

And as a bonus: I'm an obnoxious asshole. I realized it, tried to change, didn't work, and I'm pretty sure that's why I've fucked up so much in my life. I'm a worthless piece of shit, a waste of space, food, money, whatever. I'm so fucking stressed and anxious and paranoid all the fucking time and it's honestly taken all of my willpower not to kill myself so far. I find no enjoyment in living. Nothing is comforting. Before my ex broke up with me, I didn't particularly care about myself but I wanted to do what I could to make her happy, so I did my best to ignore all that shit. I'm not saying I'm killing myself because she broke up with me. That'd be stupid. I'm done with everything because I'm a waste of flesh and there are far better people out there who deserve everything I have more than I do.

I've not worked now for ten years because of depression and anxiety and some awful experiences at work.  

I never had a relationship with anyone, never believed it even to be possible, but met an amazing guy 3 years ago, but we've never been able to make it work. It's disintegrating into a mess, I can't see him anymore, it was my only shot having anyone in my life. i waited almost half a fucking century for the first person to say ""i love you"" but I'm too fucked up to handle any of it, the intimacy, the sex, the trust.

I guess I'll share first. I'm 22 and my favorite movie (at the moment) is Fearless, foreign film w/e someone out there might know it.

I hate to sound cliche, but I have been where you are right now. Ended up in a mental health hospital when I was in high school. To be honest, it fucking sucked, and sucked for a long time afterwards. Felt ashamed, felt I let down my family, didn't think anyone would ever understand etc. While it's true that mental illness still has quite a stigma, it's not as bad as it used to be. My friends and family understand now... finally, but it's worth the wait.

When I ""snapped"" I had one of two options, that I could think of at the time. 1) Kill myself. 2) Drive to the local emergency room and tell them I planned on killing myself. 2 ended up being a much better option. At the time tho I hadn't slept or eaten in days... killing myself seemed like the better choice for some reason, wasn't thinking clearly. 

Later they diagnosed me as bipolar and going through all the different medications was HELL. Don't really know the etiquette of this subreddit, just trying to be honest. Life can be fucking horrible to some of us and for others much easier. No rhyme or reason most of the time. 

Obviously since you're posting on here you don't feel like you have anyone close you can talk to, but you can still drive yourself to a hospital, I would suggest doing that. I understand that the idea of talking on the phone to a stranger (suicide hotline) seems like a waste of time. I'm just trying to offer some alternative.

I understand yearning for affection - please don't beat yourself up for wanting that basic human need.  Just please remember to accept it on your terms so your heart stays protected over all things.

From the little time I have gotten to know you I can easily see that you are such a strong and compassionate woman - just know that even the most stalwart souls have emotional requirements.  This is not a weak quality but a human one, and while it would be easier to deaden your heart to protect it just remember that the phoenix that you are going to be when you rise from these ashes is going to need the capacity to love so yes, protect it but please don't close it off completely.

I know I may have been responding as if I believe that all of this advice is easy to follow but I know from experience that it is not necessarily the case inthe.  You can be the smartest or most intellectual person on the planet and sometimes the heart will still beat the head.

It took a lot to get there, I hope you can get there at some point even though it can be lonely when you never compromise yourself for the sake of others' comfort. 

I don't quite know what to tell you about people. I find the ability to live without anyone else empowering and attractive to others. Its not really a farce for me, I have survived the times when I had no one for support or affection and I intend to survive if it ever happens again. That strength comes from knowing yourself and being proud of yourself even when no one else seems to be. People are pretty nerve-wracking still, but I know I can get through whatever crap I get exposed to. 

And the good therapists would listen to you enough and let you know them before delving into the deep stuff. I just saw a new lady and she asked me like 4 times in 30 minutes if I wanted to know anything about her. A good one will be as open as they expect you to be. You could try meeting one ( or even just calling) and explaining what you did here to strangers on the internet, that you have a really hard time being open and honest and that you have to get to know them before you can trust them. Therapy is based on trust and honesty, so to utilize it well you have to at least flat out say ""I dont trust you yet to tell you those things so let me get to know you some first."" If they're any good they should understand, if they don't and don't want to play it your way then try another one. 

also, I screened my therapists with a few questions before even making an appointment. They were all happy to comply. For example, I needed my counselor to have experienced poverty and have no religion. I found one who fit me and it made me a lot more comfortable when I went in for a visit. 

I really hope you find the strength to get some professional help. I don't see it as any different than going to the gynecologist or the chiropractor, hopefully that puts it into perspective for you even though you're a dude. I feel if you can let a dr. touch your junk you can let a therapist know what you think and treatment is treatment, mind or body you know when something is wrong and when you need professional help.

I also just can't get up an leave either since I am in a good paying job, and going to school.  

This idea of time, is just something that makes me more depressed.  How long must I stay like this?  What is acceptable?  Why should I wait this through when I can just end it all tonight?  This depression has been crippling me for several years, and OCD will not go away it will stay there.

Taking yourself out of that un-winnable ""feeling like second best"" race is the best thing you could do for yourself right now. 

And do yourself this one favor: attend at least 2 semesters of college away from home before you consider suicide (if college sounds like a good route for you; if not, try to find a job away). Not only is getting a fresh start somewhere really compelling, but college is a completely different environment than high school.

I've been toying with the idea for months now that I'm going to try to kick the bucket on New Year's.

I've been beating depression back with a flimsy wooden stick since I was 14. I'm currently in school, have a job, have an LDR guy, have friends, moved out of a crappy state... I don't know what my deal is. I guess it's just because I had a really crappy childhood with poverty stricken/neglectful parents, there was drug use, sexual molestation... had a bout of SI.... the whole nine whatever.

I'm in therapy, and have been off and on for years. I have health issues, low energy, and social issues (I often isolate myself from friends, and don't talk to them when I need help. All it does is make people feel sorry for you, and that isn't what I want).

My therapy team is going to put me on Celexa. But antidepressants have done nothing but make me horribly sick in the past.

I don't know. I just get really tired. I don't own a car and have to take the bus in a smaller city where it runs like crap. Most of the kids I grew up with are all on drugs or pregnant - I'm the only one that moved and really tried, and I did it because I thought the world was prettier than it actually is.

I'm underpaid, but work very hard, and my room's always a mess.

I suffer from panic attacks, maladaptive daydreaming (look it up), MDD and bipolar disorder, to name a few.

But I'm tired. You know? I'm tired. I know I have a lot to be grateful for. But I'm fucking tired. I can't get interested in anything new - I listen to the same music and watch the same movies and I derive pleasure from none of it. And I learned how to make a noose recently, and I want out this coming New Year's.

Suffering from depression and anxiety all of my life, it is people like you , who post here that let me know I am not alone.

If you died, there would be one less person who could possibly understand the horror of these feelings, one less person who could sympathize or show compassion to others who feel it. We are more uncommon than people think. Being sensitive is so very hard but it makes you most unique and opens possibilities for incredible understanding. 

I know it sounds like a bunch of crap but you are most defiantly not alone. I can look straight at you and know we know each other in this one intimate way. We both know what it feels like to feel this.

So yes, you would be missed. One less person who could possibly understand the torture of depression and the desire to end one's life. I can look you in the eye and tell you that if you dropped off the face of the planet, I may not know it but it would affect me.

I'm 17 and a senior about to graduate in June. I'm not really one of those angry people that wants to do it because they hate the world, I'm more just someone that's just done with living. I'm just tired of it. They say life is full of so many beautiful things but it seems like every time one of those beautiful things comes my way, it takes me forever to work to the point where I can get to it, and then before I even realize I have it, it gets taken away. But anyway, I guess I could start this off by giving some background as to why I feel this way but instead of making a long detailed boring life story, I'll just sum it up quickly. 4th Grade- Grandfather (also one of my best friends and greatest mentors) passes away from cancer. Mom starts to drink. 6th grade- Dad marries girlfriend and him and I move in with her and her 3 kids. New step-mom goes from coolest person ever to controlling psycho bitch. Now also get little to no attention from Dad unless I do something wrong. I'm also the youngest of the 4 of us. I begin to eat and get fat. 7th grade- made some friends, however also ate more, got fatter. Meet girl of my dreams. Think I'm in love. 8th grade- Super fat. Decide to start wrestling. Get destroyed but start losing weight. Summer after 8th grade- Staying with mom for summer. She drinks heavily now. Uncle dies. 2 weeks later, dog gets put down. Night after dog dies, girl of my dreams dumps me and says she hates me.  9th grade- Do better in wrestling, losing more weight and gaining muscle. Do ""eh"" in school. 10th grade- gaining more muscle, doing terrible in school, have to have small intervention for mom. 11th grade- do ""eh"", getting more fit, mom still drinks a little. Get better at talking to people (very socially awkward) even start flirting a little bit with a couple of girls. Summer- Get a job at local pool, make some money, start flirting a little with one of the lifeguards. Nothing happens. Overall, one of my best years. Now for the current, and also the worst year yet. 12th grade- starts off amazing. Getting incredible grades, have plenty of friends (although still no social life) and now I've made a complete 180 from junior high in terms of fitness. I went from 5'7"", 215 lbs., 33% body fat, and a max bench press of about 50 lbs., to 5'11"", 200 lbs., 20% body fat, and a max bench of 225 lbs. Around October- Grades still amazing. Finally have an excuse to talk to this girl I've had a MASSIVE little boy crush on for about 2 years. My excuse: she moves right across the street from me. First time we hangout: My friend and I are digging a hole in my backyard. What's the hole for? My other dog who is nearing the end of his life. I text her, asking which house is hers (she lives behind me across the street). She asks why I want to know so, I tell her. For some odd reason, she finds some sort of charm in the fact that I am digging a random hole in my backyard so she decides to come over. My friend goes home and her and I just sort of talk and hangout for a little bit. After this, her and I start texting. A lot. All day everyday. So, after a while, I decide to ask her to a movie. We go out, have fun, it's amazing. We start hanging out like every other night. Finally, I ask her if we can make it official. She says yes. I'm on cloud fucking nine. Now, fast forward about a month and a half. It's been the best of my life and the first time since 6th grade I haven't thought about suicide everyday. It's her birthday. I go over, have dinner and celebrate with her family, everything is fun and amazing. I go home. My dog is literally dying in front of me. I sit down on the kitchen floor and cry like a fucking baby. The next morning, he's gone. I'm devastated. My now girlfriend comforts me. She's honestly perfect. Jump ahead two weeks. She finally meets my mom (I live with my dad and my mom lives kind of far so I rarely see her anymore) on my senior night for wrestling (for those of you that don't know, senior night is the last home game, match, meet etc. and they honor all of the seniors). Everything goes pretty well. The next night, she dumps me. I won't lie, I cried myself to sleep. I've had eyes for only this girl and when I finally have her, I lose her right away. Now comes the best part. To put it bluntly, over the next two months, I unintentionally stalk her. I try to get her back, pushing way too hard and not realizing it until she finally completely cuts me off from her and her dad (though him and I are actually still relatively friendly towards one another) threatens to call the cops on me if I try to talk to her again. She is all I think about. When it's not her running through my mind, it's images of me hanging from the tree by my dog's grave out back where her and I first hung out. A few days ago, I make the mistake of telling her I've been thinking about suicide. She tells me to stop wallowing in self pit, grow up, and move on. I know she's right. I know she hates me. I know there will never be any kind of relationship or anything there again. But for some reason I can't stop thinking about her. I'm finally in such a deep depression that I decide to tell my dad that I'd like to start talking to a therapist. I haven't told him just how depressed I am, just that I am. I haven't gotten my first appointment with the shrink yet, so nothing's changed. Now here's the kicker, and why I'm deciding to post something here tonight: It's my school's prom night. I'm home, alone, doing nothing, while all of my friends are at prom. Including her. I log onto facebook about an hour ago and what's the first thing that pops up? Pictures of her and one of our mutual friends (I know there's nothing romantic between them, but it still stings) going to prom together. I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I've slowly already started killing myself honestly. Ever since she dumped me, I've been having a lot of stomach problems so, instead of seeing a doctor, I've just been not eating. I've been purposely starving myself. Not like anorexia or anything, where I just want to get thin, I'm hoping I'll eventually starve to death. To put it into perspective, we've been broken up 2 months, and since then I've gone from 205 lbs to 180 lbs and I get 0 physical activity per day. As I said I have no social life, just friends I talk to in school. I just want someone to talk to. I'm extremely lonely. She took my mind off of all of my worries. Speaking of which, another thing: I graduate in June and still have almost no idea of what I want to do. I'm taking classes at my Community College to give me more time to decide. Please, just help me. It's getting unbearable. I'm having trouble finding joy in anything anymore. I'm only 17. I'm way too young to have this happen too me. Lately the only things that can make me smile are listening to some upbeat, happy type music (specifically Jeremy Fisher for some unknown reason) and binge-watching episodes of Community. Help.

Likewise if you expect antidepressants to just be a miracle then you'll still be depressed. You have to work hard at it. You have to actively refuse to be unhappy, you have to find reasons to be happy, and you have to create those reasons if they don't exist. Even that won't be enough because you have to SUSTAIN that long enough so that the neurons and neurotransmitters in your brain have time to conform to a new paradigm.

There is no point in ending your life. It may not look great. but a phoenix comes from the ashes. From this you will be a stronger person. Better then others.

Try talking to your boyfriend. He may not understand the stress you are under to the full extent. I am sure he does care. You may have convinced yourself that everything you do turns to shit but that is not the case. You may just be having a bad time. Try traveling. I know that sounds out of order due too the cost of it. but even if you look around you there is beauty in nature. The galaxies that are up in space that are exploding and we are seeing it millions of years later.

You say that you are applying for jobs. That is a step not many take. It takes alot of confidence to submit to jobs and get rejected but that makes you stronger and shows a great trait about you.

I am not great with all this talking. But a person cannot feel truly sad unless they have felt truly happy before and same the other way around. Life has its ups and downs. I am sure you are going to be on your way back up soon :)

If you ever want someone too just Pm about anything you can pm me. I dont want to sound stalker ish. But If I was in the same position I would like to know that I could share my story feelings and emotions with someone.

I am not one to reach out for help; I take care of things myself, so for me to do that (and this) is incredibly uncharacteristic for me. The medication has done absolutely nothing and the counseling just pisses me off, so it seems that I'm back to trying to figure this out myself. Maybe someone has gone through something similar and may have some advice: 

I am an incredibly busy and stressed student in my third year of college -- I came in as a very motivated freshman, and with that motivation managed to get incredibly good grades, be involved in student clubs related to my major, and in general be successful with everything I was doing. Back then I was willing to sacrifice so much; I would happily stay up for 2-3 days because I thought I was finally working towards something that mattered (my career). It did not take long to realize that my coursework is primarily a large heap of horse shit though. I was/am killing myself for things that do not matter to me, and please don't waste your time trying to convince me that it is worth something. I have had several internships in which I have been told by professionals in my field that what I learn in college will most likely be forgotten and never used. Yes, the courses force me to learn to manage time, teach yourself (because professors do not teach me jack fucking shit), and probably some other characteristics that I'm forgetting. Trust me, I have that shit under control. 

So fast forward to the present:  I am an over committed student who doesn't give a shit about anything that I am doing in college, and I've lost that motivation that used to keep me going. This has compounded and depression has set in *hard*. I can't look at my work without having a mental breakdown. I can't think straight and the simplest of tasks seem insurmountable. Yet I have to hide it from everyone around me in hopes of maintaining my reputation with my fucking professional network. I think about suicide more and more often, and at times become obsessed with figuring out the best way to do it (did I mention I'm a massive perfectionist?). It feels so incredible to try to figure it out -- it's a *solution*; it's a way to get away from this fucking college life. And I would've killed myself several times over if it wasn't the most selfish act possible (friends, family, girlfriend, etcetera). But shit, it would be so fucking relieving! But suicide is not an option unfortunately. So I am stuck here, with a massive amount of work, plummeting grades, *very, very* important deadlines and I can't even look at my textbook. I force myself to work in public places so that I don't break down again -- but suppression is never the answer is it? I don't know what the fuck to do. I've exhausted every solution I can think of -- to the point that I was given an antidepressant medication. But that doesn't change how much I hate what I'm doing at college. I need to figure out a way to be able to work without falling apart. Sorry for the length of the post; if you're still reading thank you.

I have no self-worth.  Every minute of every day I am beating myself up over how much I've fucked up my life and how much better a person I should be, but I'm not, because I'm a useless asshole who deserves no respect.

Everyone just humors me because they know I'm a psycho and they're afraid of what would happen if I just snapped.  They pity me, they look down on me.  It's maddening.  

I've been through therapy.  It's bullshit.  It does nothing.  Talking does not solve anything.  I've had 4 different therapists/counselors in the last 5 years.  One quit, another changed practices, one fired me for responding ""BULLSHIT"" when he told me I deserved to be happy, and now I have another useless meat puppet to waste my time every couple of weeks.  All therapy would help me to do would be to lie to myself about how shitty everything is.

I've been through medication.  Just about every antidepressant you can think of.  It helps, but not enough.  I want out.  I feel like I'm falling apart mentally and all it will take is one setback to send me completely over the edge into insanity.

I'd need to make it look like an accident, so that the life insurance would pay off and support my family.  That's the only thing that I'm worth right now.  Worth more dead than alive.

You could leave for Europe to study there. The UK is simple, but Denmark and the other Nordic countries don't have schooling fees, education is free, you only have to cover your living expenses. There's also [this article](http://www.escapenormal.com/2011/02/23/top-6-resources-for-cheap-or-free-travel/) that shows you where to look for traveling and working while you travel.

The world is big, it's not just your house and your city and your family, those are boundaries that keep you in your head and your awful state of mind, all of those things freaking bound you in that pit of despair. Don't let them to that! If you're that close to ending it, then you have nothing to lose! Gather up the least bit of energy you can muster and try and change your medium.

I'd vote for going abroad to study. You can apply easily, it's only March, it's still ok to apply (April tends to be the latest, check out the Copenhagen universities), and once you're there, you can support yourself, the people there are open to Americans (I assume you're American). Since you say your parents have money, I'm sure they'd love it if you studied abroad. There's really nothing to lose, you'll visit a new place, meet some new people, and if it doesn't work out you'll see what to do next from there. I believe it's easier and cheaper than changing college or cities in the US, but if you can do that and just get out of your town, there's no time like now!

20983,,True,caltrain208,,,,"Hi! Thanks for posting this, it´s helpful for me to read. For nearly my entire life I felt empty, as if something were missing. I wasn´t quite sure how, but I knew that I was just not quite like other people. I was horribly lonely, even with people around me, and I had no idea why. Growing up I tended to jump from one obsession to another, a thing to do to mask the emptiness I carried with me. At first I loved insects and knew every type in my town, then I became fascinated with computers, trying to learn everything I could. After that it was trains, and more and more obsessions, as a way to distinguish myself. I went four years without missing a workout except for a week on several occasions, and it never fixed the way I felt. The distractions worked well for a time, but the same feeling that I was just different would come back again and again. 

I kept expecting the next period of my life to be the time I just figured it out, the time when everything would just be okay, I could be like a normal person, but that time never came. I didn´t do any drugs or drink at all in high school, but I went to UC Santa Cruz, and quickly found various drugs and alcohol, which I began experimenting with. Things went pretty well for a time, I would smoke weed or drink or take a little addrall or ritalin to study now and then, I loved the feeling, but I didn´t go overboard by any means. Over time I started to realize how wonderful having all these drugs was- I could change the way I felt whenever I wanted to, I could improve any situation I was in. 

I started to use a little more regularly, only once or twice a day, and just in the evenings if it was a downer of some sort. I had the privledge of being able to choose from many drugs, so it was easy to switch up what I was using frequently, that way I wouldn´t get physically dependant on anything. A lot of drugs really helped to relax me a little, I didn´t have all the thoughts running through my head, no fear of not fitting in, I was just there, and everything was allright. Drugs did wonders for the way I felt, I got relief, but they always comedown after a time. I found it easier and easier to make excuses to use more than I planned, and started giving up working out, I didn´t study nearly as well as I could have, I didn´t spend hardly any time looking for work, and the crippling feeling that I was a failure/not good enough/unlovable/different started to come back, and my solution to the way I felt started to become a problem. I went deeper and deeper into the cycle, eventually spending more that half of three months blacked out on benzos, alcohol, and a ton of other drugs.

The times when I didn´t have any strong drugs or I wasn´t fucked up at all, I desperately wanted a way out. I moved to San Diego and back, to the SF Bay Area, tried doing different things with my time, tried spending time with new people, tried everything I could think of, but my depression and anxiety was crippling to the point I was afraid to leave my room at times. I desperately wanted to die but I couldn´t bring myself to try anything other than half assed attempts to OD or get hit by cars. I remember vividly waking up in a pool of vomit and blood, waking up frmo a blackout in which I had tried to end my life, and seeing the look of shock, disgust, and pity on the faces of the people I love. Everyone else was moving forward but I stayed in the same place. It was as if all my friends and family were watching me die slowly, and there was nothing I could do. I felt like I had a hole in my stomach and a cold wind was blowing through, freezing cold and empty. 

The daily struggle was to put off smoking weed or drinking or doing some other drug for as long as possible- that way I may have a chance of getting something useful done. If I started early I´d usually spend all day smoking or looking for other drugs to aquire, and I had everything I could possibly want! Nothing did shit to fix me. I knew that if I started smoking or doing whatever drug I was taking a break from it would be back on again- the same cycle where I´d get way fucked up, go for longer than I planned to, possibly do something stupid, and end up really desperate, crying alone in my tiny room wondering what was wrong with me. Yet somehow every time I could convince myself that this time would be different, because I had some new idea or plan. Basically, I was fucked.

Then came the day that I spent weeks blacked out, fucked up a lot of shit, and called my close friend begging for help. Somehow word got back to my parents and they picked me up from my house. I turned 20 a few days after I moved back home with them, and I still had some drugs, plus a new setting, so it was alright for a little while. Eventually the day came that I was out of drugs, out of alcohol, out of money, and out of ways to get drugs or money. The pain was crippling and I had taken the last of the drugs I needed to detox off benzos and alcohol, so I came to my Dad and told him I needed help. I went in to detox extremely fucked up.

Today the fear, the lonliness, and the feeling of conscious seperation from is gone. I haven´t had a drink or a drug in more than a year (just turned 21) because I´ve found what I was looking for that whole time in the bottle but couldn´t quite obtain. I am at peace with myself, happy to be alive, and absolutely love life. I followed a few simple directions from people who wanted nothing from me other than to help, people who had been where I had been and had recovered. Anyways, if you´re interested at all I can tell you what I do, but it really doesn´t work for those who aren´t willing to do anything to find a way out (and no, it´s not a religion or anything). I hope you´re doing well, take care. ",,0.0,,2011-07-19 04:31:57,,,0,False,,,,0,,c26i2ok,,,,,t3_isxia,,,t1_c26i2ok,,,,t3_isxia,,,,,,,,1427364445.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

Sounds exactly like a major depression. Have you been diagnosed?


&gt;No one wants to take on human anchor. A dependent. 

Not many, that is true. But someone is out there for you.

&gt;No matter how much love &amp; companionship that person--I--could give, it's just not enough. I'm sure of it.

And you are basing this statement on your last relationship? Different relationships play by different rules, friend.

You need help, &amp; you need support.  Support your Friends &amp; Family are simply 1) Not Qualified to Give &amp; 2) Even if they *were* qualified they would be too enmeshed to do so.

I would recommend you call 1-800-273-8255.  I am familiar with the grinding relentless anxiety, and I would strongly recommend you might want to try [Nar-Anon, the support group for family of addicts](http://www.nar-anon.org/).  

If you are here, then all other priorities are rescinded, and you MUST get help.  Your friends simply cannot (not will not -- cannot) give you the help and support you deserve and need.

 The thing with falling in love though, is you have to love yourself first before someone can truly love you.

People throw this saying around all the time and if you think about it, it makes sense. If I loved someone who hated themselves I'd be upset with them for hating the person I loved and it would make me sad.

You don't have to be someone else, you just have to be you and love you for being you. Then another person will be capable of loving you for you. Maybe it won't be the girl you fancy right now but a girl who truly loves you will beat out a crush who doesn't every time.

Are you getting quality sleep? Are you going to bed at the same time each night?

What is your diet like? It's possible you have low iron which could cause sleepiness. I know it's also likely related to your depression but proper eating is really important.

It's really rough to deal with things without insurance or the funds to do so. Have you looked in to see if there are any free counselors in your area? They are pretty much a diamond in a bunch of quartz but they do exist in some places. Therapy aside you can look at downloading a CBT or DBT book from the internet which I did find helped a bit.

No. He was a condescenbing asshole and this is the worst sub for assholes to browse in. So what - I'm lectured and he goes unscaved?! This is bullshit. I didn't want advice. I wanted to vent and to talk to someone - not have someone be a smartass to me and degrade me.

What makes you think I **don't** put effort in it?! Oh my god. Fuck you anbd everyone here. Oh my God. Everybody is berating me, saying I'm not putting any effort in. 

Didn't you even see where iu was considering going to rehab? You don't know shit if you think that's a fucking walk in the park. I have to bare through physical withdrawals, be away from family for 6 months, and fight what's one of the most difficult addictions in the world. And you sit there and tell me I'm not putting any effort in it, when you don't know anything about me?! Disgusting.

I did not try. I did not take 10 deep breaths before expressing my feelings, which were almost always anger. I did not stop and think, ""wait, how will this effect my future? My relationship with this person? Paying bills on time?"" 

I live impulsively. I have never met someone as impulsive as myself but I do not believe anyone enjoys living this way. The fear of making a decision in a split second, the guilt and consequence of that decision you just made without thinking about it first. 

Life is not easy for anyone. I never once put myself before others. It may have seemed that way, but while my mind is racing, my eyes are all over the place, and I am about to cause a seem, I am trying my hardest to think about the other. But there are two sides of my brain that go against eachother. 

It is a lot like having two people inside of you. Or in my case, several. I cannot agree with myself. I cannot win. I cannot admit to being wrong, when one part of me will always think I am right about everything. 

I do not like meeting people. I want to stay in my bed all day. I go to work only because I need money to stay off the street. I enjoy my job, only because it keeps me out of my bed for 24 hours a day. 

I smoke because it will get me out of bed for 3-7 minutes every few hours. I can breathe. I can think about the smoke leaving the cigarette. I can hear it. I can watch the ashes form. Everything is still for those few minutes. I can focus. 

Part of me loves going out. But I only go out in the sense of, ""I am going out to be around people I will never see again"". I will go out with my best friend to a bar in a different city and pretend to be Russian. No one can talk to me. 

I do not sleep with people- I will not hook up with people. I do not think about sex. I do not initiate it, even in a long-term relationship. My significant other will be angry towards me because I am not a sexual person. 

But what do I really wish for? I do not trust myself to make decisions anymore. If I was given one wish I can already promise myself that I would have messed it up. Wished for the wrong thing. Made a selfish, stupid decision. Short term decision probably, too. 

I wish I was never born. I wish maybe I was an abortion victim, a miscarriage. Died as an infant. I wish these things on myself not because I am selfish- but because I am a mistake as my own, and I am overwhelmed with the guilt of causing my family and loved ones grief. 

I cannot stand myself. I do not like myself. I am a very beautiful 20-year-old girl- I am very good with makeup. I wear hair extensions everyday. I am tattooed. I am 100 pounds, you can lift me up and put me on your shoulders with no problem. 

But even my appearance does not change what I think of myself. I feel like I am satan. This is not a religious post- I have been told by loved ones that my mood can resemble a witch. Keep in mind that this is not a dnd post either: no wizards allowed. 

I am a horrible person. I will tell you to leave. To pack your things and get out. And as soon as you go to do so, I will scream, cry, throw a tantrum, maybe start scratching at your skin, do something stupid. Who knows anymore. I've done it all. I've sat on cars. I've fist fought a loved one on a lawn for walking away. 

There are demons in me. I don't know their names. I do not know them as friends, nor enemies. I can feel them. And that is not enough. I do not know what they want from me, why they chose to be in me. What they want me to do. 

They make me laugh at you when you are angry at me. And if I didn't scare myself enough- I do not need to be called psychotic because I cannot control it. Something about you being angry at me. Screaming at me. Raising a hand at me. Something wants me to spew out, ""just do it. Just do me a favour and do it"". 

I wish someone would do it. Every day I think of what I could kill myself with.

I went to my GP (family doctor, I assume you're in America, I'm UK,) and explained this.

94747,,True,[deleted],,,," You sir, know very well you are good for more than your listening ability. You have gone above and beyond for your friends and family by aiding them with their issues and listening to them, something you have sadly found out is a fairly rare trait these days.  If your friends do not help you and in fact talk shit about you, you need to drop them. Pronto. I know a lot of people hesitate when it comes to that, but if they have driven you to this point then they sure as shit are not helping. You need to be around people who deserve your time and attention. They don't fit that description.
 
  I do not know how good your relationship with your parents is, but beyond talking to them (and talking to them in a calm manner, which can be even more difficult than dropping friends when all you want to do is shake them and scream.) I'm afraid there isn't much you can do but ignore them.  The same with your fiance. It won't be easy. A hit like that will take a long time to get over. But it is possible to get over it. It is possible to either reconcile with the family and try and get them to understand your situation better, or if you decide removing yourself from them is the better option, it is possible to live without them. It may not seem like it. It may seem like you'll never get out of this depressing rut. But you can do it. It is possible. Others have done it before you and while it is an epic emotional journey worthy of an LOTR style movie, you can end up throwing all your inner rage and emotional turmoil into a giant volcano (I sadly don't have something to compare the volcano to, sorry man) and come out better for it.

 Best advice I can give you, outside of reaching out to the various suicide hotlines or talking to someone (your school may have someone equipped to help, but I would look into it first.) is to give yourself a break and focus on you. Do what makes you happy. Instead of helping out friends all the time, read a favorite book or watch a favorite movie/TV show. Play some games. Try to get out, even if it's just going for a walk. Try to meet new people. Go to a pet store and look at cute fluffy animals. Check out your cities subreddit and see if they have any weekly meet ups you can go to or if there are cheap/free activities you can plan to attend the next time you have some free time. 

 I can't give you a point of living, only you can do that for yourself. But I can say it'd be a damn shame to lose someone who actually listens and tries to help people, even when they have their own issues they are battling.  Ya'll are a very rare breed and are something to be treasured rather than thrown away.

Its not like I'm a bad person who deserves all the shit that happens to me (at least I think not), but everyone that tries to get close to me gets hurt because I am so messed up. 

I dont know how to describe it but I just dont get people, they treat others so badly yet that is ok to do if it is to those who ""deserved it"". I'm not a saint by any means, I have made my share of mistakes but nobody deserves the pain people have put me through. This attitude I have is kinda messed up, i know, but its there because its the only thing that keeps me from losing it. 

I feel like everyone around me gets hurt because of me. Emotionally hurt or physically hurt. The emotional part is easy to explain, who wants to be friends with the person that is on the verge of losing his fucking mind?... yea i thought not. I feel like I am losing my mind because someone I care about is dead because of me, not in the way that I killed them or something like that, but their death is still my fault. he was my friend Jimmy, he understood I was screwed up and was patient with me, he never got annoyed when I had panic attacks around him, or when I deflected any time he tried to figure out what was wrong. But one night he couldnt keep that up anymore because he was having a bad day, (he had come to my house to stay the night because he needed to be out of his house) he started to yell at me when I tried to be as helpful as I could to calm him, but I didnt know what to say, so i really didnt say much. He got mad saying he had always helped me and why couldnt I even try? He told me I was too fucked up to be friends with. Then he paused a moment and said he needed to take a drive to clear his mind, but he would be back. He never came back that night, I thought he had been so mad he couldnt come back. I gave him his space. The next morning I got a call from his mom asking if he was still at my place, I told her that he hadnt stayed the night here, he left at about 2. She said ok sorry, and hung up the phone. Later that day she called back, I could barely make out what she was saying because she was crying so much, but she told me what happened. He had gotten run off the road by a drunk driver and his car crashed into a tree, and that he didnt make it, because nobody found the accident scene until the morning (I live near a huge forest), they never found the drunk driver. He never would have been driving if it weren't for me being the way I am. Every day since it happened, all 87 of them, I have had that thought, that I am responsible for someones death. And I just hate myself more and more because of it.

I wish I wasnt this way. I wish I was normal, and not crazy. I hate myself more and more every day because of it.

my head is very quick to turn on itself. and the last thing i want to read is that someone has an accepting home life and have found their purpose. some people need that stuff. i believe you are like me and it doesn't help. more jealousy than anything. 

as someone that is regularly suicidal, i understand. i'm not much older than you. and i can't see any future of myself. i really didn't think i was going to make it through last year. i had 3 attempts, and for some reason i wasn't successful each time. i don't believe in god due to the fact why would he allow people like us to exist. but something keeps me here. 

i'm going to give you the best advice i follow. no one is going to save you. no one is there to magically tell you how to be happy. i see that you have experimented with gender expression and that shows there is conflict inside of you. i get the vibe you are a ""loner"". so am i. society pushes you to believe that you have to have people to support you. ""you need family and friends to be happy"". this is bullshit. this is society confirming bullshit. i've had everyone in my life turn on me at some point in knowing them. people are selfish, they will choose themselves before you. that was hard for me to accept. 

anyways, what i'm trying to get to is that some people don't have the same support system or life style as mainstream society. its all lies and deceit. either they are lying to you to make them look like they are doing well, or they are lying to themselves. so you gotta stop reading their BS and realize they aren't you. 

hell, i'm at the lowest point in my life right now. but i'm here telling you that life ain't so bad. i just gotta figure myself out. i'm complicated. so complicated that i don't even know who i see in the mirror anymore. i have a feeling you may be the same. i wish i could just want to live in a house that was handed down to me and live with my high school sweetheart. that just isn't me. i would be so miserable. 

i don't know what i'm really getting at. but as i said, as someone that thinks of para-suicide daily. there is a shred of some unknown that keeps me curious. the conversations that you are having from this thread. you would have never had them without feeling the way you are. even though there was a lot of negative responses from you. i see that you were paying attention. you may just need to use this experience to be around total strangers trying to talk you out of it. this shows you that there is some weird energy in this world that wants you here. feel it. embrace it. know that the future is there no matter if you see it or not.

55309,,True,SQLwitch,,,,"&gt; you seem as a person who won't mindlessly bash me for my decision

I will sure try my best not to do anything like that.  Even if I deplore your decision, I totally respect your ownership of your life and I try to make sure that my words and actions are congruent with that.  

What you've said here makes a lot of psychological sense to me.  You don't say how old you are, but I would guess you're younger than me.  And don't worry, I'm not about to launch into a ""if you just hang on until you get older and wiser you'll see that what you're thinking now is stupid"" song and dance :-)

But what I do know is that there are lots of people who have nothing wrong with them, who purely through circumstances never get the chance to develop socially in the early part of their life,  And then it gets into a vicious cycle in adolescence and well into younger adulthood (I would say up to age 30).  It's part of why the SAP meme has taken off, I think, so I will use ""SAP"" for shorthand.

So the SAP is uncomfortable in social situations.  And the SAP is only around other people roughly the same age, and they are mostly empathetic enough to perceive the SAP's discomfort, but they are not self-aware enough to attribute it correctly.  So, what they perceive is that they are uncomfortable when the SAP is around.  So they label the SAP as weird/unlikeable/loserish or whatever.  And so the SAP's social discomfort increases and the cycle repeats.   And it's completely normal for the SAP to feel frustration/rage/hate towards the social groups that he most wants to connect with and feels most rejected by.  Hate develops out of hurt, after all.

I think the reason that this is so common is in part because our culture is so stratified by age.  In healthier cultures, SAPs would be identified and socially-mentored by older and wiser socially-adept penguins (the former SAPs) and they wouldn't be ""stuck"" in the SAP role.

All of which is maybe just a long way of saying that I agree with you about the ""fucked up"" part, but not about the ""retarded"" part.  And the ""fucked up"" part is extremely unlikely to be any fault of your own whatsoever.

Because while the urge might be there still, the reality is that there just aren't any great explorations to be done right now. And even the minor ones have waiting lists a million miles long. And of those, they're pretty much just compromises on the scale of gaming. Explore water, that's filled with water! Possibly find a microbe slightly different than members of the same general family! 

People suggest exploring nature or the like. Again, been there, spent much of my life traveling to do so. It was great, but it never totally scratched that itch for REAL exploration. Same with urban exploration, even before it became so popular as to pretty much ruin much of the appeal.

I saw texts and it's not like he was just sending her shit, she was participating. She said she doesn't want to only have every slept with one person(me). I can understand that, but I don't feel the same. I am totally happy only sleeping with her. Or If we tried new things I always thought we would be trying them together. 

She's gorgeous. I've let myself go. I'm fat. I try to stay in shape, but I can just never stay committed. I'm pretty insecure about myself. My penis is on the smaller side of average. I've done some stupid things in the past that hurt her and she always powered through it. I've done a lot of things I really regret. 

I tried not to let this bother me, but I broke down the other day and I just made things worse. And now she says it's not even about having sex with someone else- that she has been unhappy ""for a while"". The thing is I thought we were happy. Our daughter just turned three. I helped my girlfriend get a job that she really wanted- she did so well in the interview that they offered her slightly higher pay. We just got a new car. She is going to go to Cuba next month with her friends as a graduation gift. But I guess I have been on my computer too much (I don't think so. I think I've actually been on my computer less). We don't do enough things as a family. She feels like she has been taking care of two kids, she says. And I think if we didn't have a child together, then she would have left me already.

I feel worthless. She says that I am amazing and stuff like that but then only tells me about the things I am doing wrong. I feel like I can't do anything right. I have a job I like that makes a difference in my community, but I don't think I'm very good at it. My supervisors aren't too happy. My friends are less and less interested in being my friend. The cherry on top of it all is that my birthday was just last week and all of this just got dumped on me over the weekend. 

I've always had trouble with having self-worth. It's just she always made those troubles go away. Now I realize I just had covered up the problem. I had convinced myself that it was gone... that idea... that knowledge- KNOWING that I am worthless. But it was all still there. In the peripheral. Waiting. 

She is staying at her dad's. She wants to take a break so we can figure out what we want. I told her I would change. I hate that cliche but it's true. But I don't think she wants to come back to me. She is worried that I am going to hurt myself. She knows I cut myself. I think I did for attention earlier. But she doesn't care. It's just pushing her away more. All I've done and said and cried about for the past 2 days has only made things worse. I felt like shit before. I felt like killing myself. But I actually cut myself this time. She's knows I think about suicide. But I think part of her would be relieved if I did. She's more worried about the impact it would have on our daughter- which I understand and worry about too. She doesn't want our daughter to grow up in a broken home like she did. Her mom cheated on her dad and it devastated her. And she has always been terrified of becoming her mom. I'm scared to tell her that now I see a lot of her mom in her. It's kind of eery how similar our situations are. Her mom resented her dad because he was complacent and it tore that family apart. 

I love our daughter more than anything. But I hate myself. I told my girlfriend that I hate myself and she asked how I could expect to her to love me when I can't love myself. And with that line of thinking, how can I raise my daughter? How could I possibly let her be raised by such a loser? There are lots of family members who could do a better job than me. And if I kill myself now, then she'll barely remember me-and the pain- within a few years. 

I don't think I can hold on until I die of old age. I'm tired of fighting this. The older I get, the closer I get to killing myself. I'll hurt them now, sure. But down the road, things will be better for them. 

My debts won't be passed on, though they'll probably take my new car to pay some of it off. I've laid out the things of mine that can be sold. They should bring in a bit of money for help with the loss of my income. 

I plan on writing three letters. One to the world saying sorry, but it's always been a battle fighting suicide and that my daughter and girlfriend have been the only thing that has stopped me from doing it sooner. 

One to my girlfriend to say sorry. It isn't fair that she carry me as a burden for so long, but she will get over it. She'll be better off. 

One for my little girl. She's too young to read or even understand my feelings if I told her, but I would have it dated for her down the road. Maybe at 13 or 16 or 18. I'm going to explain that I have a lot of issues, and that because of my suicide, she will probably also have issues. I am going to say sorry and tell her how much I loved her. She can come out better than I did. She can be strong and smart and beautiful and that it's never too late to become something. But there are things that I've done that make me want tap out. I've been the happiest I've ever been being her dad. And I am so grateful that she has given me the love that she has. My family loves her so much, they'll take care of her. Do a better job than they did with me. 

I have a couple ideas of how I'll do it. Probably get a little drunk first. Nothing that leaves a giant mess. My friend drowned when I was younger. Her body was all bloated and I don't really want my family to see me like that.

&gt;My existence improves the lives of family, friends and acquaintances --- even if the improvement is subtle.

&gt; No parent should have to bury their child.

My suicide would cause these people grief. This is the main factor holding me back. On the other hand, this is my life and the feelings of others shouldn't necessarily deter me from ending it given the magnitude of suffering. I won't care about the feelings of those I've been close to after I'm dead.

&gt;The Little Things in Life (TM).

The decision of whether or not to live really comes down to whether or not the sum of my experiences (not the right word, really, but I can't think of the proper substitute) is positive. Sources of small happiness count toward this, too. 

    life.big_things + life.little_things &gt;= 0    

&gt;It's still possible that my net happiness will eventually outweigh my net suffering.

Counterargument to the above. Waiting to see if this turns out to be the case would be the most rational option. I would have plenty of time to experience nothingness after my natural lifespan has expired. However, given the treatment-resistant nature of my depression and anxiety, as well as my family history, it seems unlikely that I'll ever fully recover. 

&gt;I haven't yet listened to all of the music/seen all of the films/read all of the books that I would like to.

On to the section of the list where I rattle off things that I haven't done yet. Of course, these could all be negated by the argument that I won't give a shit after I die.

&gt; I've never created a satisfactory work of art.

Attempts tend to result in frustration rather than catharsis.

&gt; I haven't tried all of the drugs that I'm interested in.

Feel free to judge me. It's kind of sad that this one is on the list, in retrospect.

&gt; I have never been in a romantic relationship lasting longer than a week.

&gt; I have never had sex.

These are, depending on who you ask, major parts of life that I would be missing out on.

&gt; I have never been in a band.

&gt; I haven't fully explored my gender identity yet.

&gt; Though I'm no longer in class, I haven't yet technically graduated from high school.

&gt; It's still possible that a college I would like to attend will accept me.

&gt; I have not had the ""college experience"".

&gt; I have never traveled the world.

&gt; I have not satisfied my desire for knowledge.

&gt; They're making a third season of Twin Peaks.

Again, I can dismiss all of these easily.

&gt; People will think I've done it over something trivial.

Just noticed in your original post how you describe your anxiety about the future triggering a flight response. One method that athletes and performance artists use to combat this reaction is to move the body - through running, dancing, yoga, etc - to calm the body and build resilience. Another method is to use conscious breathing to relax the body. While you are laying in bed, it can be nice to do body scans - just being aware of each part from head to toe and breathing deeply and relaxing.

I'm so full of regret for having been a selfish asshole husband and father. I'm also Christian and lived a very self-centered life, completely opposite to the teachings of Christianity. I can't get past it. My wife now hates me, and I long for reconciliation and she won't  entertain the idea until/unless she sees changes which she says she hasn't so far.

I'm out of work, laid off. I got a software developer job a little while ago and was let go after a couple months because of a ""skillset mismatch"". I wasn't coming up to speed fast enough. It was damned hard with all this other stuff on my mind. I know I wasn't able to give ti my all.

Took a shower, then laid in bed again until 5. I can't face life. I just want it to fucking end.

I'm scared to be alone. I'm scared because I see my life going down the tubes. I go on Facebook and see all my friends posting about their lives. And I feel so lonely. I want to scream. I want to post ""Thinking of ending it all"".

I've written a suicide note to my wife. I have some rye (I'm not really a drinker) which, if I execute my plan, I'll be drinking, and then taking an OD of sleeping pills before bed. At least this is the plan. I'm scared though. I may chicken out. And you may hear from me again in a few days because the desire to end it seems to be constant.

The hospital bills are an array of visits due to an allergic reaction that put me into the early stages of anyphilactic shock (sp?). The allergists, doctors, nurses, all have no clue. So I have 3k in bills and a few dozen pokes and prodes on my skin (makes it look like track marks) for them all to tell me they have no idea. So, I'm severly allergic to something randomly (I'm thinking it's a hair product...but they aren't sure.) and owe tons of money and they won't work with me on a payment plan. I told them I could send a certain amount a month until it's paid off and the nurse told me that's unacceptable. If they don't have the full payment in 90 days, I get sent to collections regardless.

I was suicidal for many years- in some pretty dark places. I would have bet anything and everything that it would never get better. But then I started making changes. I quit using (recreational) drugs. I quit smoking. I quit drinking. I started seeking professional help. I started taking anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications.  I started exercising, lifting weights and doing yoga. I stopped hanging around toxic people. I stopped eating fast food and started eating healthier food. I started reading more. I became more engaged in my community. I started researching and studying the worlds religions and philosophy (devout ignostic), I fell in love, got married and had a child. 

Had someone said to me that cliché line 10 years ago, I probably would have had the same response. But guess what? The world changes. People change. And you too will change. The only question is, will you change for the better or for the worse? Only you have the power to decide. That's the beauty of free will. 

You say your problem is permanent, and I'm not trying to sound insensitive, but maybe you're just trying to justify the easy way out because you're not willing to put in the time/effort/energy to become a better &amp; happier person. 

There's a better and happier you deep down. You just have to work really really REALLY fucking hard to get there. Maybe in 10 years you'll look back and be dumbfounded how you could have ever felt this way.

So I did some sleuthing though your previous posts and found that you said:

In the last 3 years or so I've understood deeply how much my family really does love me and how amazing my group of friends is and how they'd support me and enjoy my company and how me being gone from them would feel like losing a limb.

This is my point exactly, YOU changed YOUR OWN perspective. You understood something you previously didn't.  Life has a weird way of teaching us lessons.

It initially was an idea of ""hey ill try to help this person transition"" but its been a year since we've broken up and my presence is both a boon and a depressor for her. 

She wants to be with me, however I just dont want the relationship and that fact kills her, however having me in her life helps alot because she has no one else. Being there for her is both bad and good and ends up just canceling itself out 

Its very hard for me to stay because im privy to her freaking out at me, random trips over to her place to calm her down, and once in awhile anxiety attacks which turn into rage blowouts and threats coming from her. Not to mention the continued emotional stress of someone regularly threatening to commit suicide.

However its also hard for me to cut her out, because despite all the negatives, I know that she does them because she is hurting. and its not like she hasnt tried to get help. Since Ive known her shes sought a therapist, a psychiatrist, tried medications, and done other things to improve her life. The main issue is that she has no family left and no close friends which really kills me inside because despite all her attempts to beat depression, she just has no one left in her corner due to life tragedies. rather unfair

Today we had a fight, she basically told me a horrible selfish person for not wanting a relationship with her, I flipped out (poor sleep last night and being very fed up with having that conversation again) and ended up leaving. Now, she is drinking and taking valium that she was prescribed to calm her down, giving hints that tonight is the last night and so forth. I have to wake up early for work (3am) and its like jesus what do i do. Ive been in this position so many times and its the same cycle over and over. She comes off as malicious but at the same time I know shes freaking out because of the inner hurt/anxiety/etc.  If I go over now its just a short term band-aid but if I dont I feel the consequences could be very bad.

What I want to say is that expressing - like.. screaming it out.. is something that CAN help. A lot.

I go on walks and just scream at night, and it helps me a lot.

Listening to music that helps me with it is something that actually keeps me going. (A lot of metalcore/metal)

I also do my own forms of yoga/meditation, because just emptying my mind helps me a lot.
Helps with calming your body so you can handle a job and stuff like that.

If you have social anxiety and stuff like that, it DOES get better, ESPECIALLY if you're expressing yourself a lot.
Music is a big deal for me, mostly metalcore sorta stuff. (visual art is great too)

Finding other people who want to make music/art is a big part of life, it's something that's actually worth living for. 
&lt;3.

I've been through places where I never believed I would ever recover again, and I'm still there in some ways, but I DO think I'll be able to live and at least make music the way I want to.

It's been a long road through hell but I'm finally somewhat through it, and I just want you to know that ITS POSSIBLE. And that sometimes, screaming outside at night (in ways that feel safe) is actually worthwhile.

&gt; I went to a diner I have never been to once and the young woman serving me just so happened to have went to the same High school I went to. She had noticed I had lost weight and was looking better for myself, giving me compliments along the lines of handsome, or insisting that I look good. She was hitting on me, or maybe just being really friendly. We had a small chat which I actually enjoyed. I have been to the diner anywhere from 50-100 times since that first encounter, yet do not go beyond pleasantries with her even though I enjoyed her company. That's my problem.

Your experiences with psychologists, well it sounds like you ran into a string of shitty ones.

Try to find a new doctor, one who will put you on a drug that will work, maybe Effexor or maybe another SNRI.

Look for a local medical clinic that offers cheap care, if you are fairly young you should be under your parent's health insurance so that could help pay for it.

19422,,False,breathingcarbon,,,,"First of all, thank you for sharing your story here. I'm sorry to hear you feel every day is progressively more of a struggle. From what you have described, I understand you have a 2yo daughter and another baby daughter?

It sounds like you are working full time and that your wife is not helping out with the care of your child(ren) as much as you need her to. Have you tried talking to your wife about how you feel and asking her to help out more (if she is able)? Is there anyone else apart from your wife that you can talk to or that could help you care for your family?

You say that your wife went through breast cancer 3 months after your first daughter was born, and it sounds like you did not feel very supported during this time. Coping with the birth of your first child and then also with your wife's breast cancer must have been very difficult. It sounds like you have a lot of resilience, to be able to go through an ordeal like that. What strategies did you adopt to help you deal with the situation?

You say you feel your daughter is a bright beacon that keeps you shackled to a life you hate: that you feel like you are simply the provider of a pay check, and that you are ""out on the sidelines"". You contrast the life you are living now with how life was before starting a family, which sounds like it was full of great adventures.

Have you thought about how you might combine the two aspects of your life that you seem to really enjoy: your daughter and adventures? Just because you have a family now doesn't mean that you can't find some way to do the kind of things you used to enjoy doing.

Ok, so maybe it won't be riding motorbikes around the world, but is there maybe somewhere beautiful nearby with trails that you could hike – perhaps even with your family? Going for a run sounds good, but running until you hurt and have to sleep under the stars sounds like a pretty bad idea to me. And if you disappear for a few days I can absolutely guarantee that people will miss you, and they will worry about you, so please don't do that.

You say that you yelled at your daughter after being kept up all night, and that you feel hurt by your own behaviour. I don't think you should beat yourself up about yelling at your daughter; can you forgive yourself for being human and try to do better next time?

&gt; The scariest part is there is no one out there who can just scoop me off the floor and fix me.

Now, believe me when I say I know how ridiculous this sounds, but here it is: there *is* someone out there who can just scoop you off the floor and fix you, and that person is *you*. You say you just got through today: that alone is testament to your ability to scoop yourself up off the floor for every single day in your adult life up to and including today. That's some serious scoopage – good work! It would be a real shame to break that streak. And as for the ""fix me"" part, well believe me when I say that you will only ever get to that part if you carry on scooping.

During anxiety attacks, all suggestions to ""Just forget about it/ignore it/stop reading about it, etc."" are challenged by a sort of ""If I'm not going to worry about this/take this seriously, who will?"" sort of mentality, as well as a general feeling that nuclear war is inevitable, and as currently I possess no coping methods for this mindset, it leads to a general feeling of just wanting to die, and as the conflict progresses the desire is becoming stronger. Actual suicide is highly unlikely due to a desire not to leave friends, family, and loved ones behind should nuclear war ever occur, but I'm afraid something severe self-harm wise will happen if coping methods for these extreme and crippling fears don't develop soon.

23004,,True,[deleted],,,,"It's funny, because of course you are exactly the sort of buddhist *they* scorn as being fake.  There seems to be a very high prevalance of elitism and self-rightiousness in buddhism, just the same as we see in some of the weird and not-so-wonderful variants of christianity, where people *so* easily write off others who apparently fail to follow the tue path.  Being Sri Lankan, they are deeply critical of people like you, most especially westerners, who claim that it's possible to have your cake and eat it too. You would be dismissed in a heartbeat if they met you.  So in that way, it is pretty funny to read your reply.

This pair are, to be honest, absolute nutters.  They have raised an isolated, guilted, shamed, desperate and deeply suicidal young man - the reason why I know them in the first place.  

Seeing your enormous list of dos and don'ts bothers me a lot, because that's exactly what depressed people need the least.  I don't think it's an innocent list of helpful hints.  Depressed people question themselves endlessly and find fault way too much already, so anything that even implies they should be doing more of the same is counterproductive, I believe, and at worst very damaging.  I think you could have spread a much better message of ""loving kindness"" without telling people that they *can* be happy, but only if they just follow your advice.  It's not that simple and is setting some vulnerable people up for failure.  Seeing such a wall of text is potentially very daunting and enough to make anyone give up trying! 

 I think you mean well but fail to understand that people need less lists, less instructions, less dos and don'ts, less self-criticism, and much more acceptance of the person they are right now, warts and all, depression and all.  There's a difference between doing something and talking about doing it, and we all fall into the trap of thinking we are doing the former when really doing the latter.  If you are concerned about suicidal people, I think you would help a lot more people if you talked less about buddhism and simply enganged with them as a real, caring individual who doesn't dispense advice but simply listens.  I know that's what you say you are doing, but your actions do not align with your words. I suspect you would be actually very surprised to learn that you are not on the ""right"" path in life, just ""a"" path, the same as everyone else.

I got mono earlier this semester and got really behind on work. I dropped to three classes, and still can't catch up. I try to work on things and get lost in thought after around 30 minutes.

I lost most of my friends in the past few years. I had a shitty relationship that cut me off from the rest of the world, and after ending it 6 months ago, I haven't had any social network to speak of. I deleted my facebook and no one noticed, and certainly no one gives a shit.

I'm ashamed of myself. My hobbies are embarrassing and unrelatable. I'm awkward as fuck. I get really excited about things no one gives a shit about. I have learned to desperately hide my actual personality, because it's off-putting and weird. When I open up, people don't know how to react. I realized that when I was more social, people made fun of me frequently behind my back. Ex-lovers constantly told me things about myself that needed to change.

I wish I could just cut out the parts of me that make me myself. That would be easier for everyone. Since that's not really an option, I'm just going to do what I can, I guess.

I've thought of ways I could kill myself and the idea of not having to live made me feel relaxed in a weird way.

But I had a dream. It was odd. In the dream I managed to receive a box of pills that would end my life. I swallowed one of the pills and waited for death. I felt a sensation of relaxation, I felt calm, I felt happy in the dream. I looked forward to death. Then in the dream,I suddenly began to think of all these things that have made me happy in my life. Small things. From the small walks I go on, to the video games i've played, to the books i've read and films i've watched, I thought about tiny small things that once made me happy and I realized that now that my inevitable death was coming, I would never experience those things, even small, again. I began to regret my decision and I hoped to God that I would survive the pill I had just swallowed. 

Then I woke up.
And despite being just a dream, like any other... I suddenly am feeling less inclined to end my life. I'm beginning to appreciate small things just a little more. Things are still shit, but I appreciate what I do have more. If I die, I'll never get to experience those things again. I also realized the things that once made me happy, not all of it has left me. There are still things in this world that can draw a smile from me.

I don't know why I had this dream.
I don't know why it has changed me.
But i'm glad I had it. I'll keep grasping onto life and search for new things that will make me smile. I know there are still things I have yet to experience. I hope for the best.

8794,,True,Kaladin_Stormblessed,,,,"All of these are things that will get better in time.  I know how hard that is to see now, because you are in the middle of it, but I have been almost where you are, so I hope I can give you a little perspective, coming from the almost-30 side of things.

All of the things you mentioned are social norms which you feel like you have to live up to.  I assume you are in High School?  School is so rough.  :(  You are expected to do all of these things which are socially acceptable (going to parties, being in relationships, being ""sociable"") when you just might not be ready for these things yet.  They're not who you are, and others make you feel left out because of that.  

**But it is OK that that is not who you are.**  Your peers are not you.  They have no say in who you are, what you enjoy, what you do with your life.  I was a virgin until I was 18.  I played D&amp;D and FF8 and hung out in anime chat rooms when I was in High School.  This did NOT make me the most popular person in school, as I'm sure you can imagine.  But I turned out OK.  And a big part of that was going away to college.

There are other people like you out there.  People who are socially awkward and enjoy video games more than going to a party and getting stone-dead drunk.  People like me.  And if you go to a college, chances are you will find at least one person like you to connect to.  

Try not to let what other people think of you define you.  Be you, make yourself happy, and once you've got that, you can start reaching out to others in real life.  Social awkwardness is tough, but if you can find someone with similar interests to yours, you can start to form a connection with them.  And a connection can turn into friendship, friendship into confidence, and your social awkwardness can become a thing of the past.

So please don't give up now.  You have so much more life to live, so many chances to turn things around and do amazing things with yourself.  Giving up on the game so early would be wasting all that potential.

I've never had any particular interest in growing old. All I want from a career is the means to afford good food and good diversion. This is an empty life, one without purpose and without impact. What difference then if it ends now, in twenty years, or in sixty?

This is compounded by my psychological conditions. Oftentimes, my depression manifests as a heaviness in my chest and limbs, a slowing, numbing factor that annihilates movement and stimulates thought. My compulsion further fuels the drive, as I experience visions of my demise extremely often - every several minutes. Sometimes, it's all I think about for hours at a time. While my preferred method is seppuku, the compulsion considers all forms of self-termination. I've often pictured gunshots, hanging, driving my vehicle into inanimate objects, etc. A large part of me wants to give in to these ideas.

  If I cant kill myself right now, tomorrow I will be on another bus going to work, and everyday I get worse. If I keep on living how many days will I be able to maintain my sanity? How many days will I suffer?

  I dont know shit anymore. I just dont. I am helpless. I am hopeless. No way out, no life nor death for me. Too lame to live, too coward to die. I am in the damn Limbo. Like a ghost of a dead man flying around.

 I took professional help, it didnt improve anything. 

 I am 25(M), had only one real friend and never had a gf my whole life.

 I just want to die.

But I figured that title would describe my situation most accurately.

To start out, I am a meteorology major.  It started out when I was a little kid.  Thunderstorms scared the living shit out of me; honestly until I was like...13...But I knew I always wanted to be a meteorologist.  After high school and my first semester in college, I really realized how much math is required (a lot,) and I had second thoughts.  So I enrolled in a few other classes; journalism, film classes,   etc.  But the main thing that happened was I joined the U.S. Army Reserve.

I left that summer (2006,) went to Basic Training and then Advanced individual Training afterwards.  My MOS was 25M, Multimedia Illustrator.  I had always loved drawing as a kid, so it made sense.  After AIT, I returned home, and reported to my actual unit, a Psyop unit.  It wasn't long after that I got sent to Iraq.

I don't claim to be infantry, or any of the guys who were going through the cities, seeing combat and such.  I was just a desk jockey with Psyop.  But our base was fired on.  And more importantly, we intercepted enemy Psyop videos.  I know the popular reddit opinion is against the U.S., and especially our military.  But there are FAR more evil things in this world than America.  I have seen them.

This is not something I talk about to many people.  I don't think I've even told my own family about this.  But the worse thing I have ever seen was an enemy psyop video we intercepted.  It had the usual elements; bad guys hiding some where and shooting up passing humvees, etc.  But this one in particular had something far worse.  Apparently, the insurgents had caught 3 children (approximately 12-14 years in age) helping coalition forces in some manner or another.

Needless to say, they weren't too happy about it.  They were not in some cave, or some hidden bunker, they were outside on a street, for all to see.  They had the three kids hog-tied.  The laid them down in the street.  Then two of the insurgents came up with butcher kitchen knives, and put them to their throats.  At first, I thought they were just slitting their throats, but no; they actually sawed their heads completely off, and then put the severed heads on top of their dead bodies.

They did that to the first two kids.  The third kid had to sit there and watch it all...and know he was next.  I couldn't watch that poor third kid be executed.  Those images of those poor fucking kids being murdered is burned permanently into my brain.  And I can't help but wonder if what I did caused their deaths.  You see, I was pretty much a graphic designer for the Army.  I made posters, hand bills, pamphlets, etc.  They were anything from wanted posters to ""pick up garbage"" posters.  But I can't help but wonder if those kids saw my products, went to help coalition forces, and got murdered because of it.

I won't lie, there was definitely a time while I was still in Iraq when i put a loaded gun into my mouth.  But I never pulled the trigger.  But when I got home when was when most of the self-destructive behavior really began.  I had over 3 grand saved up from Iraq.  So I bought myself a new Mustang, and proceeded to become an alcoholic. (I had turned 21 while I was in Iraq, so I had making up to do.)  It was during that period I burnt A LOT of bridges, due to my alcoholism.

Eventually, an ex-girlfriend of mine recommended I see a therapist, and I did.  She did help out with a lot of issues I had, and I felt better; and I become better.  For a few years.

Flash forward to more recent times.  After joining the Army, I switched my major to graphic design/visual communication since that was what I did in the Army; and I liked it.  Eventually, I got extremely bored with VisCom, and went back to my childhood fantasy of meteorology.  I did one semester of it at Northern Illinois University, and applied at what I considered the ""harvard law"" of meteorology; the University of Oklahoma.

I got accepted, and once I got there I felt like a freshman again.  I joined all the relevant student organizations, etc.  More importantly, I met my at the time girlfriend. She lived right next to my apartment, and we fast fell in love.  And honestly, it was the happiest I've ever been.  But it was a very rocky relationship at first.  She was a southern girl from Oklahoma, I was an athiest guy from near Chicago.  But after our turbulent start, we made it work.  And as I said, it was the happiest I've ever been.

During my second spring there, we decided to live together.  One, we were madly in love; and two, I was hurting financially and moving in would help us both.  But it was not long after that happened that I broke up with her.  And not just a normal break up, but very nasty break up.  She literally assaulted me and threaten to kill me.  I could have called the police and have her arrested, but I didn't.  But needless to say, I got my shit and moved the fuck back to Illinois after that.

But ever since I've been stuck in the purgatory.  We have in the mean time made up, and are friends again.  We talk almost daily.  But at the same time, my dream is gone.  My dream of graduating from the University of Oklahoma is over.  My dream of me and her, (and our dog,) living happily ever after are gone.  And I kinda though when I moved back home, there would be a bunch of girls from back home waiting to take a shot at me.  Perhaps there were one or two, but I pretty much screwed those up with my...alcoholism and just overall not being ok with the break up yet.

Anyway...the point is that I feel...extremely alone....I very rarely see any of my friends or family.  I'm not going to school at the moment, but even if I was, it wouldn't be at my dream school of OU.  And being as I work in a bar now, I'm pretty much getting drunk every single day.  And I am having vision problems that may or may not be related to that.

Honestly, I feel sometimes like I just don't want to bother going on anymore.  I've made it 26 years.  One hundred years ago, that would be a long, accomplished life.  I really don't feel attracted to any other females, aside for a quick lay (which I haven't done.) I just feel like I have no future, nothing to look forward to, and worst of all I abandoned my family in Oklahoma (my ex-girlfriend and our dog.)

There are other reasons I don't want to continue a romantic relationship with her but I won't get into that now. 

She has serious depression and self-image problems and has been cutting since she was 12. I got her to stop while we were dating but I was powerless when that ended. Now, a year later, things have gotten worse. I've remained her close friend and given her all the support I can. She claims that she's still in love with me and blames me for her depression by not giving her another chance (I've been careful not to lead her on). I've tried removing myself from her life to help her move on but she says that if I leave she'll kill herself. She threatens suicide almost every time we talk late into nights and I keep having to talk her down. If we don't talk I'll wake up to 30+ texts from her and a dozen or so FaceTime calls. Her family is no help; they put her down and have been calling her fat (she gained 40 pounds when we broke up which does not help). She's performing way below her ability in school which, as she sees it, gives her no hope for the future. She refuses to see a professional. It's taking a serious drain on me. My grades are suffering from late nights and I feel myself becoming more and more depressed after being around her, but I feel guilty just thinking about leaving. I've had to skip class and miss opportunities because she needs me that moment. She always says that if she kills herself it'll be my fault.

My question is, should I tell my friend that lives out of state or should I leave him completely in the dark? If you were him, would you be happier not knowing for sure what happened? He knows I've gone through a lot though so I feel like he'd put two and two together. I don't want him to think I'm not sorry for whatever pain I may cause him if he did figure it out, so maybe I should say goodbye?

I considered creating some elaborate excuse as to why he might not hear from me again. I'm not very creative though so I figured I'd ask for some ideas. I just want to lessen how this would affect him.

What you need right now is to talk to your mom or your dad or a trusted family member. Realize that your depression is a lot more serious that simply a lonely day.

When you cut yourself, your body releases a bunch of hormones called oxytocin that make you feel high and good about yourself. It can be very addicting. It's not healthy at all.

Please, from one cutter to another, seek help, and follow through with it. I went to the hospital and they committed me. I talked my way out of being released and what do you know, here I am drinking again.

My shrink is useful only as a pill pusher. There is another shrink there though, who is good at her job. I dropped her only because her office hours were inconvenient. I might see if I can change back to her again. Right now I don't have a therapist. I got assigned to someone who was retiring, and I saw her once. It was actually painful.

I have spent the last 6 months desperately trying to find peace.  It shouldn't be that hard, I've dealt with prolonged lapses of sever depression myself.  I know what it's like to feel nothing.  I know what it's like to want a way out.  What I can't understand is the feeling that there is ABSOLUTELY nothing left to live for.

During my bouts of depression, whenever I came to the point that I was truly contemplating letting the world go on without me, I always had a reason not to.  The reasons could be small, for instance... I'd be embarrassed that my house is so disheveled.  Or, the reasons were huge... I could never leave my Mom and Sister.  Regardless of their importance, I always had a reason that my brain latched onto as a way out of taking this drastic step.  

My Father, even though he has two daughters and wife... His brain didn't latch on.  His brain, through the fog of depression, still decided that there was nothing to live for.

Today I found THE blog post.  If ever I need to explain depression to someone who has no darn clue what it feels like, I'll show them this blog post.  [Hyperbole and a Half Explains Depression] (http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/)

Read the blogpost.  It has pretty hand drawn pictures.  

I made this post and chose the subreddit for a reason.  Not because the above has changed my life and left me with no grief or questions about my father's death.  That isn't the case.  I made this posting so that one of you will go to the link I provided.  Use it to realize that you aren't the only one who feels the way you do.  Use it to help verbalize your non-feelings to the people who love you (because they do love you).  Use it to help explain to your potential doctor your symptoms.  Use it to realize that there is hope.  Depression Lies, but you can choose to kick it's ass.

Also, you're only 13, so you still have plenty of time to date. Plus, in high school there will be more girls and more opportunities to go out. Some girls might not even be able to date at your age, because their parents might not let them. Personally, I would advise you to give a little less attention to girls right now. I'm 17 and have never had a girlfriend. I feel that I have an advantage because of this. I can spend my time doing whatever I want, whether it be playing video games or hanging out with my friends, and I don't have to give up any of my time for a girl. I've lost a lot of time with some of my friends because of their girlfriends. Ultimately, I would say do not commit suicide. You'll find a girl someday, and those days might be the happiest days of your life, but right now spend time doing the things you love! Make memories with your friends! Cherish these moments as a young teenager. You'll appreciate it when you get older.

As for depression, talk to someone about it. Whether that's your parents or your school's guidance counselor. Talking about it with someone can help by just getting all your emotions out. Plus, if you feel like you need further help, these people can help you seek further help, like a psychiatrist or a therapist. Always remember: there is a way through this.

I wanted to have something I could be proud of. and have everyone around me be proud of me, and respect me.

I tried to maintain some sort of fitness. I was basically was a very fanatical young man obsessed with serving my country. But more on this part of my life later.

In tenth grade we had a fire in our two story shed. And thanks to me goggling my address one day I found my local fire companies website with a post about the fire at my house. Then I saw the ticker that said they were accepting new members; And that they accepted members 16 and 17 years old as Junior Firefighters. I figured I knew a couple of people in the Firehouse and that it might help get me ready for the Marines so I signed up. At first my Family and Friends didn't take me seriously. They figured it was a phase and that I wouldn't actually do it, but I did. From my very first drill night, I was in love with the fire service. It was like I was accepted into a family. and that's exactly what it was. As the Probie I got my balls busted for just about everything. But after the drill we would all go up to the rec room, sit around, eat pizza, and crack jokes; and for once I felt like I belonged and was accepted. 

I really came out of my shell because of the firehouse. My confidence in social situations was mediocre at best, but it was better than non existent. I was a little more out going when it came to talking to girls; but again, still mediocre at best. I did manage to ""get lucky"" a few times. But there was a level of guilt and shame because I was never one for a one night stand. I suppose I wanted an actual relationship.

In my Eleventh grade year I started Fire School. Which was a blast, and I made a lot friends. But every time I think about fire school. I'm reminded of my first Fire Service funeral. In about Novemberish of 2012, A guy in my fire school class, committed suicide. It was also the first time I saw a grown man cry. At the start of the class, instead of the usual greeting and briefing from our lead instructor. There was a man dressed in a class A uniform. Which I've come to learn is usually never a good thing. He was the chief of the guy who killed himself. It was just so weird to me. Having never experienced suicide. And I wasn't super close to the guy, he was apart of my Fire School crew (Engine 6, if anyone was curious), So we worked together as a unit. But we didn't know each other all that well, in essence we were teammates, that's all. But when he killed himself, for some reason, it got to me. Eventually I got over it. Well I thought I did, but I'll explain more of that later. I finished fire school, and started riding the truck. and I felt great. I felt in control of my life, and most importantly I was proud of myself.

Then the Summer before Senior year came. I finally was allowed to talk to a Marine Recruiter about Enlistment. I was so happy, I was going to be a NBC Defense Specialist. I was going to defend the country against the scourge that is the National Broadcasting Corporation. In reality, the MOS stands for Nuclear Biological Chemical Defense. In other words, HazMat, which I was fine with because I actually enjoyed the HazMat part of fire school. But when I went thru MEPs I was given a medical DQ. I felt crushed, I had spent my whole life working toward this. I wanted to become a Marine so bad. And I was told flat out. No you can't your back is just the slightest bit over our maximum impairment. 

That's when I started to fall apart, so to speak. I went back to my old self. Keeping to myself, just spending every second focusing on all of my failures. I saw the accomplishments I made, but I always thought: ""Well how long til I fuck this up?"" or ""Well this was just a fluke."" I eventually graduated. But I tried to kill myself about a month before. I tried to hang myself backstage in the school auditorium, but I heard someone enter the other side of the auditorium and for some reason I decided against it.

After graduation I got a job at the local grocery store in produce. But I still had these thoughts of failure, and an occasional thought of suicide. Then in the beginning of Decemeber 2014 I was going to try and kill myself again. But before I could I got a text from this girl I knew, She and I texted from time to time, And I was helping her with her problems with this boy she liked she but she was too scared to say anything. Well she texted me, and told me the guy she had a crush on, was me. 

And for the first time in I don't know how long, I felt genuinely happy. I had always had a crush on this girl, but I figured she only looked to me as a friend so I never said anything. So we tried to put together a date. However, because on certain circumstances her mother didn't feel it was appropriate we date. So for about a month we just talked a lot, I would see her every so often for chorus practice. I finally worked up the courage to tell her I love her. She had replied and had said she loved me too. And I felt great, on top of the world, unstoppable. But a month later, a few days before my birthday, She broke up with me. And ever since then, I've been back to how I felt before, only worst. I tried to kill myself on Valentines day (I suppose I was being poetic). But the rope I was going to use to hang myself, snapped. Some would consider me extremely lucky; But I could feel anything but lucky. At this point I think the only reason I'm not is because how much it would hurt my friends, my sisters, and my brothers at the firehouse. But I still think about how I could possibly kill myself with things in my everyday life. And I have started cutting myself, I'm in the process of figuring out how to hide the scars for my upcoming Structural Burn at the firehouse. If they see the scars, I'm worried that my gear is gonna get pulled, and they are going to say a possibly suicidal Firefighter is a Liability. And I understand that, but I have reasoned that if I lose firefighting, it will make everything that much more worst. I have all these problems and my friends always tell me that if I need something to say something. But at this point I feel like I'm more a burden then a friend. I always wanted to be the guy who put service to others before myself, and always making others better. I just don't know anymore...

24508,,False,waldgnome,,,,"ok, first, if you have all these thoughts is to focus on yourself. 

Before you try to get a girldfriend or friends, start being social with people whose thoughts about you sou don't fear as much. 

1 You could volunteer. Be it with elderly people, animals, environmentl issues, homeless,... etc. Many elderly and other groups of vulnerable people are happy about attention. Even if they are rude, you will learn to deal with it. Maybe you will see, that it's not about you, when people react angry or anything. 
You can also interact with the people you work with, you don't need to fear their reactions as much, because they will be happy about any help and if anything goes wrong you can leave and start over somewhere else. 

2 Get hobbies. Maybe for now you can start hobbies that are just about you, drawing, wood working, sewing, cooking, swimming, running, anything (I'm not that creative right now) ...best would be anything physical. Or learn about things, maybe you can make some kind of certificate. Or join some voluntary service where you also learn stuff, like at a fire department. I don't know when you can start this in your country. The more you realise that you know stuff or know how to do stuff, the better you will feel about yourself. 

Or you start stuff that involves others, where you have to work with a kind of partner as in climbing, taek won do and the like, ... or you can try group sports.

You don't need to be too interested in 1 or 2. Just start doing stuff, don't get lost in negative thougths. Also, interest in an issue isn't always there from the beginning, it develops.

You can start with small stuff if that seems to much for you, even if it is just cleaning your room.

Also: Don't be too hard on yourself. Everybody is rude sometimes. Sometimes we notice it, sometimes we don't. It will happen throughout life, to anyone. 

Note down things that were positive on a day, you will remember the bad stuff anyway. But you NEED to remember the good stuff. A smile, a nice talk with a cashier, a person towards which you were polite, a green light, ice cream you enjoyed in the sun, some food you cooked, something good you said in class, ...

From what you've written it's totally understandable that you might feel like you're doing everything humanly possible to 'get over' what happened or to 'recover' or whatever the 'in' phrasing is at the moment, and you'd be totally justified in feeling like none of it is working or will ever work. It's awful what you've been through and are still going through. 

It's amazing you're holding it together as well as you are, and you deserve a lot of credit and respect for that. You're still working, being there for your husband, take meds and attend psychiatric sessions. Plus, you're doing all this even without feeling any benefits right now. You genuinely couldn't be 'doing' any more than you're doing.

I know that suicide may seem like a magic gateway at the moment, like walking through the sunset or sinking into the ground or dissipating into the air, and the desire you must be feeling just for a moment of peace or relaxation (let alone happiness) must be achingly powerful.

I know this is small comfort, but just as you have drawn a sense twisted hope from the story of the accident, you're post will have already given many people hope. You've already achieved the hardest part of this process - you've asked for help.

I find it almost inconceivable that a child could fail to love and cherish a woman, a stranger, who had gone through and survived so much, let alone it's own mother. Also, children grow and change and develop their own opinions. Even if your ex does twist your child's perspective of you, the facts speak for themselves, and very, very soon you'll be seen for what you are: a survivor, a fighter and a good person.

I really hope you find a way to improve your situation soon.

42336,,True,MeVicCar,,,,"Oh yeah, there is so much out there. I have found that the more I search and discover, the more I begin to shift my focus in terms of the questions and problems I am concerned with.

But as for how your philosophy currently breaks down - you are making some rather large leaps in understanding. The two areas that stand out to me the most are differences between finding and creating meaning and how that relates to your separation of man (as a conscious being) from nature, and then the assumption that happiness can only arise from meaning or comfort in the knowledge of some absolute truth or purpose. 

I would suggest two things: The first is Albert Camus to start out with for the philosophy bit, and the other is setting a monstrously high goal for yourself - one you can't possibly achieve, but might be able to - like becoming a master of the piano, oil painting, guitar, or some other hobby that you may already be into. Make sure it is something where you are producing some object that can be experienced by others. The point of this is to get you focused on process, and not the end results. You will get frustrated with the hobby very quickly if you are focusing on the end product, because the end product will undoubtedly be an eyesore (or earsore). If you desire to continue towards the goal, you will then be forced to focus on process. The end result, consequently, will undoubtedly be better. This is because in all creative pursuits the end product is really just the representation of the decisions made during the process of creation. Another way to understand this is that it is not necessarily true that 'the journey is more important than the destination', but it is true that the destination is simply the accumulated result of the steps made during the journey. In this sense, you cannot disassociate the journey from the destination - they are intrinsically linked. This is true for art, and I think, for happiness as well.

How does this apply? Well, it just seems to me that you are spending most of your efforts 'looking' for happiness, or trying to 'find' it by participating in certain activities or changing your environment. This is a good approach, no doubt, but flawed in a slight yet significant way. Do these activities for their own sake, not for the desired results that these activities are beholden to produce. It is the difference between a novice painter wanting to paint like Rembrandt, and Rembrandt himself. It is the difference between a child being forced to play piano often and to perfection by his parents and hating it, and a child playing the keyboard in the living room on his own accord every now and then and loving it. 

Don't place expectations on happiness, just DO things. That is the most important thing I think, doing and learning for the sake of doing and learning. Once you stop that process, things spiral down real fast. There are many different reasons for this, I think, stemming from the biological realm and evolutionary theory, but that is an entirely different discussion. 

The main thrust of what I am trying to say here is that growth is what makes me content with the way things are. I know that as long as I am growing and learning, I will not be unhappy. Whenever I get depressed, it is because I am resigning myself to mental stagnation because I have somehow convinced myself that it is impossible for me to grow in a certain area. Luckily, in my more lucid states I have learned that this is never true, and it is my hope that you come to this understanding as well. You seem like a smart guy (gal?), and I am quite sure you are capable of achieving what it is that you want. I just think you need to be challenged to do it.

SO, get the butter from the duck ;). 

edit: and you truly have such a downer perspective on what it means to be a human. It isn't wrong, its just... glass-half-full. Yes, we are just a bag of chemicals, but we are a bag of chemicals which have organized themselves in such a way as to produce sentience, intelligence, and consciousness! Amidst all this, this huge unconscious universe with all of its billions of galaxies and trillions and trillions of stars, some relatively few chemicals have produced consciousness! An awesome, powerful, and humbling thought for me. I owe it to the rest of the unconscious chemicals, my unconscious brethren, to carry out my consciousness to its fullest extent. ;)",,0.0,,2011-12-25 03:13:41,,,0,True,,,,0,,c3az3nw,,,,,t3_noqde,,,t1_c3az3nw,,,,t1_c3axcqh,,,,,,,,1428072285.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

I feel like I’m taking all the right steps, but it’s just going through the motions and I don’t even really care.  It would be so much easier to just disappear.  Keep driving and never come back - I wish I could somehow jump up into the sky and it would be dark and cozy and  full of nothingness.  Whenever I see a small space, I have to physically stop myself from crawling into it.  I’ve already planned how I would like to kill myself.  Nothing dramatic, just to kind of go away.  I don’t even think there would be that many people who’d notice.  I’m just so tired of everything.  I just don’t get life anymore.  I only get out of bed every morning because I don’t want my boss to think I’m a bad employee.

I used to be such a normal person, though I was always shy.  But after years of therapy I learned how my parents treated me growing up really affected the way I think about myself.  My mom should have left my dad years ago, but she didn’t and never stood up to him for us or even herself.  Blah blah blah.  Plus I’m very introverted, which I always told was “wrong” and have only recently accepted.

My shyness turned around when I went to college and made so many friends and people liked me and wanted to be around me.  And boys.  I always got great grades, and having a social life was the best feeling.  I was even the president of my sorority.  I don’t know what’s happened since then.  

Everything just seems to have gone downhill, but I can’t figure out what exactly has caused it.  I think I am not good at being a person.  After college I was happy.  My friends and I would go out and spend time together.  I liked my job.  My best friend passed away unexpectedly and it was rough (my family never even asked me how I was feeling).  One of my friend’s BF did something to me one night and I never told her.  I stopped spending time with those people.  I lost more friends when I was in a relationship where he didn’t like me spending time with anyone but him and though I knew it was ridiculous, I still followed his rules. I loved having him care about me and I loved caring about him.  I love taking care of others.  It was physically and mentally abusive.  We ended up pregnant and I ended the pregnancy.  He fractured my jaw while I was pregnant, and I knew there was no way I could have a child with him.  He hated me for that decision and how selfish I was.  It broke my heart, but I couldn’t have him being involved in a child’s life.  I can’t even describe the feeling of that loss.  It’s like the heaviest empty space sitting on my chest.  Not sure how emptiness can be heavy, but it is.  I broke up with him over and over.  But he would always return begging me to take him back, telling me he’d changed.  And I wanted him to have changed so badly.  So, I’d take him back and the cycle would repeat.  He told me so many things that I know sound lame, but I think they confirmed the voice in my head (how pathetic, stupid, used and usable, ugly, disgusting, etc., that I am).  It makes us sound like we were trash, but there were good times too.  That was months ago but I still think about him hourly.  I wish I hadn’t left him, he at least gave me something to live for.  I don’t know how to make friends anymore.  

I just feel so alone.  I’m so tired of this.  I still see my therapist and talk to my two best friends, but I feel like they’re busy with their own lives.  My family lives far away and doesn’t really pay attention to me, plus they think I have everything together.  I guess from the outside I do, I have a great job, a couple friends, my health, etc.  I still workout and go running and volunteer and spend time in nature, but nothing really makes a difference.  It doesn’t make me happy, it doesn’t even make me feel anything.  I recently drank too much at a work event which embarrasses me and feel like I ruined the one last thing that I was good at and liked.  If I don’t leave my apartment for days, no one would even know/care.  I know I have a tendency to overthink everything and get stuck in my head.  But I don’t want to do this anymore.  I feel so lost.  I just want to push a button and go “poof” and not exist anymore.

I used to have one, but I missed 2 appointments without ""Calling ahead"", so they refused to see me again until I paid off the 200 dollars I apparently owed for missing appointments. I understand that, Im costing them money I suppose by not showing up for scheduled appointments.

But I wasnt aware of the repercussions of missing appointments.

I know how I got the psychiatrist last time, I went to the hospital after calling 911 and crying to them. They put me in a locked ward for about 9 hours of the night. When they finally evaluated me and deemed that I wasnt going to hurt myself if I left, they let me leave. They gave me some papers and an number to call. They diagnosed me as ""Clinically depressed"" and made an appointment for me with a local psychiatrist.

So it was all paid for.

I just want to know how I can get back into an appointment with another psychiatristm paid for by OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan).

I really would rather not go back to the hospital ER and tell them my story, because I know I'd be place in another room for a day, and that really fucking sucks. Being surrounded by schizophrenics and people suffering from mania while being watched constantly by security guards and doctors is a really weird feeling. I dont like knowing that I cant leave on my own accord. Not to mention I lied to the doctor evaluating me, only because I figured that if I made sure that he thought I wasnt much of a threat to myself, he would let me leave (which he did).

I just want to avoid that whole process.

And you are totally fine with all of the rules; no worries about that! Most of them are there to make sure that people responding to posts are as helpful as they can be. It's understood that when you're posting here, you're in a difficult place emotionally and reading through them can be a lot to ask. 

It sounds like your anxiety has really taken over your life in the last four years, changing not only what you're capable of doing but your very perception of yourself, and ending your relationship with your boyfriend has left you without enough support to keep going. Your insightfulness in writing this indicates that you're keenly aware of what's happening in your head, but you feel powerless to stop it. The image of being deep in a desolate wasteland is powerful and haunting.

It also sounds like you're conflicted in wanting to relate to other people. There's something in you that wants very much to be understood and to be connected to others, and yet that wants to push people away and is afraid she can't be loved...

If it's okay for me to ask: what does it mean for you for it to be all or nothing? 

One thing that can be useful to keep in mind: it's rare if ever that who we used to be is ever completely lost to anxiety, however much it feels submerged in depression and terror. This fact doesn't negate the anxiety, but it does mean that we're *more* than just the things that are wrong. We've all of us got our brokennesses about us, but beyond that there is a wholeness, too, and... no, there isn't a certainty that you'll be able to shift the balance all the way back to it, but I do hope you'll be able to find more of it again. 

But it's understandable to find this hard: the wasteland is a terribly rough place to be. I hope we can walk through it together.",,0.0,,2014-06-01 05:52:28,,,0,False,,,,0,,chw6ovx,,,,,t3_27099t,,,t1_chw6ovx,,,,t3_27099t,,,,,,,,1434042303.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

This would be the first school with both boys and girls I had been to, so I thought I could make friends with some girls for once to try and be more normal as I never really talked to any girls before (too shy, spent too much time indoors). Stupid idea. The moment I walked in to the school I realised this was completely impossible, I had no idea how to do it. It feels so pathetic to be 16, in the second last year of school and not know how to talk to a girl. I felt so abnormal, once again I started to hate myself and I realised how hopeless I was. Luckily about 3 guys who I knew were there. One fucking broke, he doesnt talk or anything, just stands there and stares basically (he was basically my best friend which isnt saying much) The other 2 are frankly dicks. So basically im completely alone in about 300 people. Many of which are people from my old school who I have already failed with and who hate me.

I used to be religious at one point, my mom made me go on some crap church youth thing, it was the same, at one point a guy basically beat the shit out of me with about 5 other guys, all the girls laughing etc. I thought, either god doesnt exist, or hes a cunt, a total bell end. 

Im just too shy to really function normally. I wanted to get cognitive behavioural therapy but I dont have enough money. My family signed me up for some volunteer work thing, I have to go tomorrow, I am fucking dreading this, every time I feel remotely good about myself, something will happen to completely fucking smash any self confidence I had gained and made me want to kill myself more. Made even worse by the fact that I literally have no one to talk to about any of this, my parents are not bad people, they are just, really distant. My dad is indifferent, maybe disappointed that he got such a fucktard of a son. My mom is just distant really.

Please don't yell at me. I'm a high school senior failing two of my classes at this really prestigious and expensive high school on a scholarship. And I've been working my butt off and seeing teachers and redoing assignments, but it's not working. An F can reduce my grade to nothing, while an A only raises it up to two points (if I'm lucky). I've been getting As in these two classes for a while, but I'm still at a D and an F and I can't fix it and now I'm seriously wondering if it wouldn't be better to just die. 

My family is very poor and they really resent me for costing them money even when I'm on a scholarship (we still have to pay something), and they would get their money back, which would go to my brother and his education. I've been working and working and I've struggled with severe ADHD, anxiety, and depression, but nothing I do is working. All my other grades are fine (not fine, but passing), but these two grades are bringing me down. 

The worst part is that I used to be a stellar student, getting all As and participating in an Honors Orchestra. I had a mental breakdown and entered a deep depression, and that was when my grades started falling. Now I'm in almost all AP and honor classes, struggling like crazy, and though I'm taking medication, my grades still suck.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Everyone's been telling me that if I just work harder, if I just do this and this, then I'll be okay. But I won't.

Wow original,  I'm a good looking guy I guess I'm tall, skinny kind of fit I shouldnt have anything to worry about right I can get any girl, see but I'm different than a lot of guys I actually respect women, I know shocker right coming from the guy who sees no actual point in life, well I wasn't always like this, I used to want to be married and have kids maybe I don't really know, so I've been saving myself for my wife who will probably never get to meet me because I kind of want to die everyday I wake up, I think about suicide almost everyday, I have ... I guess fantasy daily that one day I'll wake up and have cancer and finally get to die and won't have to feel anything anymore because I'm to weak to kill myself, and ya you might be thinking wow what an asshole this guy wants to die when kids in Africa this and blah blah blah my mom died of cancer well with all due respect were all going to fucking die anyways so who gives a shit, am I the only one who wakes up everyday and literally can see that all use humans are doing is for nothing at all, our planet could blow the fucking kingdom com and nobody , not even the aliens that maybe exist lightyear away would even fucking notice, nor even give a rats ass because us humans are fucking pointless we have no purpose, we make our own and right now I'm having a hard time finding one, and you Christians or Mormons or whatever that believe in god I fucking envy you I wish I could put my faith in fucking something, I respct all people religions and let them think what they want because who gives a fuck I don't believe in god and you do. Yipeeee I don't give a shit. Fuck man as I'm writing this I see no purpose in it because I know what's going to happen people that see this will either ignore it or try and ""help"" me out and say that there is hope or some bullshit sob story about how you recovered from depression or some hero fucking story, but yet as I write this and see no purpose, I'm doing it anyway, ironic right. Isn't this whole fucking world ironic how people try to help other people from depression yet THEY are suffering from depression. Shit man isn't this wold so funny. What's even more funny is people think there are other people like them out there like me and they shouldn't feel alone because they'res others like them. Well don't be fooled, you ARE alone. And so am I. We're all alone in this ppint less universe. Trying to find meaning in our lives. For what? Just to die and have your children experience the same fate that we humans have to deal with.

Have you tried changing your attitude? (No offense)

If you try every advice with a long face, it won't get you anywhere. Why be positive? Let's take the rational approach: why do we live? What's your reason for living? It's why you've come to SuicideWatch, right? Assuming you're an atheist, a depressed person like yourself will probably believe there's reason nor use to life and therefore life is meaningless. 

**Wrong**. I agree that it *seems* meaningless. Even if you're a top celebrity, or a brilliant scientist that invents something that will benefit all of mankind, in the whole scheme of the universe humanity in itself is nothing but a flash.

But why not look at it this way: you're living your life already. That's a choice you didn't make. You didn't choose to be born, where to grow up or who your parents are.

But you're in it now. Right now. So why not make the best of it? Why not strive for happiness. Don't you have a list you made as a kiddo of things you wanted to do when you grow up? Try them! What are your interests? Study up. You said you tried the gym, but did you go alone? It sounds like your depressing thoughts are putting a damper on everything you try.

Kenneth Hudgins, an *actor* for God's sake, once said: *The meaning of life is to give life meaning*. And he was right. You're probably killing your own motivation by rationalizing it away.

Suicide's not worth it. Don't do it.


P.S. I'm sorry if I sounded condescending or crude, English is not my native language. I'm just trying to get the point across that life is definitely worth living, but you have to make something of it yourself.

Can you try getting a low-skill job that offers good benefits which will require only a simple interview?

I just can't take it anymore.  I love her too much.  She loves another, but I just can't stand to live without her.  Her beautiful personality, eyes, lips, just everything about her makes me want to melt.  I'm even too scared to talk to her because I know she'll be upset with me for doing so.  I gave her my all, but I guess that everything I had to offer wasn't enough for her.  I'm glad that she's happy with her soulmate, but it kills me on the inside.  I was so excited when she told me she loved me back over the summer, but I guess that she was just saying that because I was saying that.  This summer was the happiest time of my life.  I loved every moment of it.  Why did I have to be the one who got hurt in this?  Why does life have to be so tough with things like this?  She is more important to me, than myself.  I'd rather have her happy than me happy.  I tried treating her like a princess, but apparently that wasn't enough for her.  I can't even do anything in school without turning my head at her to catch a quick glance at her gorgeous caramel eyes.  I spent so much money on a ring for her, but she didn't even wear it once.  I wanted to be her boyfriend so badly.  So badly, and i still do.  I'm literally crying as I type this.  She showed no emotion towards me when I drowned in love for her.  I was so heartbroken when I found out she liked the dude who isn't even going to be loyal to her.  I still want them to be together because it's what she wants, but he's not going to be faithful to her.  Nothing on earth makes me happier than to see her face with a big smile on.  It's almost like an addictive drug to me.  But the only time I see her with that charming, lovely grin on her delicate face is when she's with him.  It absolutely hurts me directly in my heart.  Every time I tell her that I love her, I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.  I even wrote a damn journal dedicated to her... I don't know why I fell for her so badly.  Maybe it was when we were at State Science Fair?  I really wanted to give her a big hug then.  Or maybe it was because of the museum at Dayton?  I'm pretty sure it was.  When we were in that simulator together, I think is when I fell in love with her all over again.  I always liked her until this dude named Derek said he'd beat me up if I liked her.  Later I started having minor feeling for this girl named Katelyn, but then I just couldn't stay away from who I truly loved...  I felt like I could almost kiss her, and I should've.  She's literally perfect.  And when she dyed her hair to that adorable light brown, I was the only one who supported her.  Still didn't matter, I guess.  Man, I love everything about her.  From her cute head to her toes, all the way to (what's most important) her inside.  She has such a helpful personality, and she has a good heart in her.  I admire her for that.  She once told me that she wanted to go out with me in sixth grade.  I told her no.  I was an idiot.  I would do anything in the world to have another chance like that again.  Anything.  If I had the chance to start my life over again, I would, no question.  But if I can't start it over again, might as well end it.  Hannah, if you are reading this, know that I will always love you.

God.  I can relate to so much of what you said.  I was trying to write a book, I figured it would help me improve my life, something I could do by myself that if I put all the effort, care, love, and intelligence I had into it, I could make something of myself. Just throw every fucking hour of the day at it, even if everyone else was out having fun, because if fun isn't allowed, might as well accomplish something.


But the rug got pulled, never going to have the time or energy to finish. Same exact thing.  People just don't like me, and without connection life is fucking terrible.  Oh boy, a weekend!  Oh boy!  It's so depressing watching the world evolve against you and you can't even talk about it.  You just have to smile and pretend it's OK even when you haven't' sleep well in days and haven't been touched in a non-platonic fashion in years, and when you try to talk to people, they just look at you then talk about you like you're not there.

What fun. I was thinking about DFW the other day, was meditating and had this really scary moment where everything clicked in that scary psychedelic way, and it was so obvious how real that quote was.

But what I most emphasize and believe in is that expressing emotion is perhaps the most important thing people can do on their own to begin to change how they take care of and relate to an important aspect of themselves.

A lot of our internal problems and even problems over time stem from this trapped emotion and the insights it can provide. As we express emotion we are better able to see why we have come to the place that we are in, and not only that, get up out of serious mental barricades and judgments against ourselves, due to feeling through them in a sense.

Any form of expression can really help.

Once expression is a regular part of life, other forms of therapy (things like meditation) become more accessible to us, partly because our mind has had the chance to really express what it has had to hold back and down for so long.

I am a pretty smart person, I am studying physics in college, I just started this year. But I did horribly my first semester, enough to pass with a C but the grades I got are not going to be enough for Grad school. I think I want to study physics, but only because I want to know how things work, I can't bring myself to care about grades. or anything lately. 

I understand all of my subjects, but I still got C's across the bored and a D in Calc. I know I know the material and I studied and I did not goof off, but I still messed it up somehow. Intellectually I know I am depressed and what I am feeling is not right, and I need to talk to someone before I do something stupid. Yet I don't know how to talk to someone. 

I have friends but I feel isolated and alone, and it was only made worse when I came out as an atheist. I have been going out of my way to keep everyone comfortable and make sure I did not offended them or bother them, but they came to see me as only an atheist it seems, like an oddity or a freak at a sideshow not a person. 

I feel alone, I know there are other atheists at my school and I have met them, but I don't ever hang out with them and we all have different interests. I am going to a Catholic College and honestly in the last few weeks I have met some of the most tolerant and accepting and loving people on the face of the earth and become friends with them. 

I know this isolation is in my head, but it feels so very real. I know that while I feel odd around some people I am great friends with others and sharing my views has only made me better friends with them. The isolation has come from me trying so very hard to not offend anyone and still managing to offend everyone. 

Its funny the more I talk about it the more pissed off and stable I feel, I know that I am going to feel like I used to and just shrug it all off, but in 20 minutes I am going to be sitting here again thinking about ending it all. It's agonizing and frustrating I know that there are things I can do to get better, go see a psychologist, but I don't know how or what to do.

I think anytime we deal with death it makes us hyper aware of our own mortality. And how quickly it could all end. I kept thinking that point over and over, how suddenly life could end and every thing you thought every memory every smile would be forever forgotten.

People may distance themselves from you for many reasons. They may have lied when they said they loved you or not, its a case by case thing.

People think you are exaggerating because they have never been there and don't understand. In my own life I had to excommunicate one best friend who thought I was a pussy for getting depressed.

You should consider meditating, it helps focus ones thoughts. (/r/Meditation).

They want to make you believe one thing (perhaps that they care) because they want to prove it to you (they either value your friend ship or think you can provide them some benefit) or themselves (they want to have friends/be friendly/be compassionate etc a lot of reasons).

6216,,True,SQLwitch,,,,"Seriously?  You think my concern is that I'm ""offended""?   No, my concern is that you're propagating dangerous misconceptions about what helps people at risk for suicide.   

&gt; just trying to help the way I was helped 

I don't know what kind of state you were in when you received this kind of ""teaching"", but let me deconstruct it for you: 

&gt; you are the only person that can actually MAKE the change you feel like you need

What is the mindset of somebody who needs to hear this message, or would benefit from it?  If I extrapolate back, the only thing that makes sense to me is somebody with a belief that the world isn't doing enough for them, and/or that the should get more help than they actually need.  Well, both of those beliefs are totally contrary to the typical mindset of suicidal people.

In [the best model we have](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130348/), there are three necessary and sufficient risk factors for death by suicide:

1. Desensitization to pain and lethality  (this is a ""stable"" factor - once it exists it can't easily be changed)
2. Perceived burdensomeness
3. Thwarted belongingness

I.e. you don't get to be suicidal by feeling that the world has failed you and that you should be helped more, you get to be suicidal by feeling like you've failed the world and you don't deserve to be helped and you're all alone in the mess you've made.  So any message of the ""only you can fix your life"" variety ***reinforces every accessible factor that makes the suicidal mindset suicidal***.   I don't say stuff like ""you're going to kill somebody"" lightly.  

&gt;  *(not saying you're on your own, though!)*

Ah, but you are.  Do you seriously expect somebody who's *in extremis* to interpret "" the only person that can actually change this situation is you"" as ""I've got your back""?

15194,,True,[deleted],,,,"Hi sonic. Now, a few facts. Sydney, our largest city, has a huge multicultural population. The people you would be hiring for your warehouse are very likely to be Asian and Middle Eastern. Sydney-siders consider themselves to be sophisticated urban dwellers in general, and the Aussie ""bloke"" stereotype, while he exists, will be well and truly mixed in with a multitude of other types.

I'm surprised you're being asked to do a job that most people would be trained for before making a big move like this, though. How soon does he want you to move? It seems *so* surprising that I think he must have faith in you, because he knows you've got what it takes. I'm having trouble imagining any boss, no matter how impulsive, sending a ""noob"" manager to do this job - so perhaps he thinks more of you than you realise! Have you got a clear picture of the task, and exactly the role you'll fill? Are there already other managers in place? Can you call up someone in the company in Aus, and talk to them about it? I think that would be perfectly reasonable. You could say you want to find out all about the role, because you're obviously being asked to make a very big decision and want to gather all the facts beore deciding. 

Having said all that, you don't need to be alone once you get to Aus. For one thing, you probably *will* make new friends. For another, we can always call up a few Sydney redditors over on /Australia subreddit to meet up with you for a welcoming drink. And for a third, there are mental health support services around, but if you need them you'll have to be proactive enough to access them. The one I'm thinking of immediately is the National Depression Intiative [Beyond Blue](http://www.beyondblue.org.au/index.aspx?). I'm not sure how health care works for overseas workers - these are things we could look into.

Finally, though, I hate the thought of you going off anywhere when you're so uncertain of what it involves. I would love to see you gather much more information about the job - especially the exact role, what other staff will be working with you etc. You boss owes you that, even if it means a few phone calls Down Under!",,0.0,,2009-02-13 23:11:24,,,0,True,,,,0,,c07no8k,,,,,t3_7x8id,,,t1_c07no8k,,,,t1_c07nkj5,,,,,,,,1425923686.0,,3,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,3,,

I don't believe in God anymore. I believe in the scientific method. I believe in evolution. I believe I got where I am today on my own and those who believed in me.

I can't remember how but we started getting into a small fight. He was saying things like how I'm shutting everyone out of my life, which was a huge trigger for me because he is the only one that is close to me at all and in my life. He said I don't really try to repair the relationship with my mother which is a massive trigger because I have tried and the way she reacts to seeing me is disgusting but he persists he somehow 'sees' and 'knows' everything about the relationship between her and I.

He went on to say how I need a job and how I am attention seeking because I've been a victim of many things in life, and I started getting really angry saying how I'm finally reaching out and going to an employment program for victimized women and I am completely alone so how could I be attention seeking. 

It got to the point where I bluntly told him I was waiting for him to leave to work so I could s/h very badly and wait for paramedics to come and to hospitalize me. I said this because I was completely believing he didn't care, I felt everything of my existence was constricted in on the space between him and I and from what I was hearing he was telling me I was a waste of a human life. He was acting like he didn't care smiling away and nodding, like he thought everything I was saying was amusing because he didn't believe I knew a single thing of what was coming out of my mouth.

At this point I was pure adrenaline, it was rocking through my body and all my senses got hightened. I wanted more than anything to pull him near me unto the bed and start choking him. That never happened, because out of self preservation I started smiling and acting cute, slipping up, when he started smiling at me and thinking all the emotions coming from me was a joke.

I threw some clothes on with no shoes or jacket and ran out into the rain and freezing cold.

The thing is I have a normal, loving family.Two brothers that are completely social and great and talented. And I feel like nothing. I have no interests, no ambitions, nothing. I can't do anything without messing up. I don't have any talent or passion. 
I have no personality. There is nothing to say to people. I can't start up a conversation nor keep one because my mind is just blank whenever there's talk.
On top of that, I've never been attracted to girls. I don't really like anyone. I love people but I don't like(italics) them. My brains just messed up. I feel like I'll never have someone love me back. It makes me sob so freaking much every night.

I'm sure you're a curious person. Somebody once asked me ""would you really wanna live way past 100 years if technology allowed it?"" And I said ya, I'd love to live as long as possible if only to satisfy my curiosity of what the future will look like.

So in my opinion, hang around, live out the few decades you get on this earth, see how your life will turn out and what the future will bring. 

I like to make decisions based on best case and worst case scenarios. Either way you'll die one day, except this way you'll get a chance to see what the future looks like, live a long healthy happy life and die at a ripe old age. Who knows, maybe by that time your views will change.

I'm not exactly suicidal... I used to be, all the time, but events have unfolded in such a way.... That now I'm just completely alone in the world.... Before you go ""impossible"".... Here's the story.....

I used to be incredibly depressed... As I said... And in the past few years I've had the every loving crap beat out of me.... Like if there was a shitty situation that could possibly happen.... Odds are I've been hit with it in some way....

I was never one to really throw a pity party though, and if people asked how I was I'd always just keep the answer at ""fine"" unless they asked deeper.... Then I'd literally pour out my life story.... Sigh

The thing is my parents never had friends really.... Mom never had a ""day with the girls"" my dad didn't have ""guy friends"".... I mean they were sociabile people.... They just didn't connect to anyone. 

When I grew up I always had friends... I was geeky popular through High School...although too depressed to really appreciate it at the time. But one thing lead to another and I went to college away from them and we all drifted....

In college I was busy doing great...but failing to make friends.... I have exactly one friend.... But she tends to put me down a lot, and she isn't the kind of friend I can go to with things....

So here's where it all fell apart... I had a semi crap job that I liked well enough, and I was friends with pretty much everyone at work.... Although they were all ""work friends"".... 

I found my mom dead one morning, rather suddenly. She's the only person who I could actually talk to about... Well... Anything... I ended up leaving my job because I couldn't deal with it.... Now I work temp work.... Which means I never get to be in any one place long enough to meet anyone... And when I do meet people who on a friend level I think are spiffy....I can't seem to make it click. It's not like we are five and I can be all ""you're my best friend now....""

In the meantime I do have my dad.... And he and I are close.... But he's so upset about everything that it's almost like there isn't any room for my sadness... I have to be the one who keeps shit together....they were married 40 years.... 

But the thing that's getting to me lately is that he keeps saying he's so depressed zp and he feels alone and there's no one to talk to anymore.... And I totally know what he means.... But at the same time I'm like.... Er I'm still here.... I'm alive.... Hello?

Everyone cares how my dad is, how my dad is doing.... And don't get me wrong, I am not looking for someone to garbage dump my problems on... I'd like even someone to talk to about books or movies or anything OTHER than my mom being dead... After she died everyone wanted to see me and do things.... They've all run away again.... Sigh.... 

On top of it I am single.... Which is fine.... I'm overweight and so far I've found people really love my personality, but never give me a chance.... I'm in transition, I had lost a ton of weight before this happened....but boom....it's back and then some.... This comes after a major car accident as well.... But even with all that.... I'm fairly confident I am not the most ugly person on the planet.... So does it mean I have to be untouchable for a year or so until I'm ""acceptable"" to the male population again? 

So this is where I am.... My mom used to always say that bad things happened to all the people I thought were better off than me.... That I just couldn't see those things....but it's like I literally have every bad thing from a group of people on facebook piled into just my timeline.... Without the positives to make up for it. Ouch. 

I feel like podcasts are the only human voices I get to hear talking to ""me"" and I can't take being in solitary anymore. Despite all the depressing....I'm funny and nice and like to do lots of things.... I feel like I'm an on an island at the moment.... 

The saddest part of all of this was that my mom my whole life was super active in the arts.... Only 15 people showed up to her funeral.... A bunch of people wrote facebook messages.... But after all she did for so many people... I just can't.... I'm so angry and hurt.... And I don't want my life to end with no one around me. 

Tl;dr.... 28/f... Lonely and hating it. Life sucks but not exactly suicidal I just super blow at making friends or relationships happen....currently dealing with someone else's depression and I think it's just getting to be too much....",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,self,"No (wo)man is an island...

in college 2 years ago i was harassed by a student for not being immature like he was who parties and drinks, for 6 weeks, until i snapped assaulting him with a cheap utility knife on the finger. this i regret cuz it ended with a criminal record which started my whole string of never ending failures. 
the next school i tried to go to made me do an appeal process cuz of my mistake which took literally almost 2 months because they kept dragging their ass that ultimately ended in me being denied after i poured my heart out in a letter and my past therapist writing a letter that normally could convince anyone.
the 3rd school told me to wait 1 year before even applying.
the 4th school wouldnt let me apply at all.
the 5th school said they would send a release of information form for me to sign which i did 3 of at the second school and which i havent gotten.
I tried to find a lawyer to take them (them being the current school im trying to get into) to court and every single one ive tried cant do anything except for the most recent which is only open 3 days a week with the next day being monday.
I want to go to a tech school to be a mechanic but all the schools in the state that have automotive are part of the same system with the same bullshit policy. 1 law firm said to try out of state but due to probation i can't leave the state. even if i could i don't have a license because i've failed 5 times so far even after added training. I can drive perfectly fine too but each examiner i get is the overly critical spawns of hell that would automatically fail you if so much as cough. 
Ever since 9th grade when i was forced to move to the middle of nowhere i have had literally no friends. not in real life and any online friends ive had have stopped contact. 
I once tired suicide but i knew that the method i tried wasnt gonna kill me so i got a prescription for the symptoms and fixed that. i was told that my method should of killed me but i was unimpressed.
some more reasons are I've never had any female interaction that wasn't negative so i have no female relationship experience, my self esteem and confidence are non existent, ive had an issue with hygiene since 6th grade, i was laid off from a job i hate and will not go back because my wrists will be destroyed by the duty and i need those. to this day they still hurt and no it isnt carpal tunnel.

There was even a nationwide prayer chain of thousands of people all praying for me to get into the 2nd school i tried. I'm a strong believing christian and i know very well God exists and even THAT didn't work.

That is all i can think of so if you got through this unorganized mess of a story than congrats. but with all that i'm going to research better and faster methods of suicide because there is literally nothing i can do other than that.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,default,my life is nothing but failure,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2dktf8/my_life_is_nothing_but_failure/,

-Brother had cancer 

-watched my friend flip a car full of friends, pulled 4 out, and found one crushed under the car three feet from my face

-been cheated on in 3 out of 4 serious relationships

-one told me after 5 months of cheating

-walked in on one getting double teamed at her friends birthday

-one was fucking my cousin a block away

-other girl had medical issues and let me go so it wouldn't hurt me as much had something happened, she left us a few weeks later

-seeing my friend under the car left me not normal for a while , 2 out of my 4 teachers decided not to pass me when I skipped the last three weeks because I was fucked up. 
No graduation. great.

-I had a home invasion where three guys with bats came into my house, packed up all my shit, and took it away while holding me on the couch with bats(as I'm stoned as fuck after a hard day at work).

I'm going to suggest that you need to go to your doctor, and tell him or her what is going on with you. Now, if you feel uncomfortable telling the doctor about what's going on, then just print out what you've posted, and give it to him or her. The doctor will have an insight into what is going on with you that would otherwise take many appointments.

If the doctor prescribes you with an antidepressant, then make sure that you keep the doctor informed as to how you're being affected. If you have a negative side effect like insomnia, then don't keep it to yourself. Get in right away to let the doctor know, and then he or she will adjust the med accordingly or put you on something completely different. What works wonders for one person will not for another.

Get yourself checked out to see what's going on, and give the meds a try.

I've suffered from depression and PTSD for a long time, and the meds have helped me to get my life back, so give them a try.

60903,,True,xenialmind,,,,"First off, forgive my lack of experience in this area. I have absolutely no idea if what I am about to say is going to help. Until recently I only visited this subreddit because of personal reasons. In the 3+ years I have lurked Reddit, I have never posted a thing. I prefer to watch and try to gain insight on what is going on in the minds of the people that write and post here. 

However, the more stories I read on this forum, the more I have a desire to try and help. 

Although I will probably never find the right words to say, know that I am trying my absolute best to convince you that **YOU** are **NOT** worthless. No matter how people treat you, how they perceive you, or how they act around you just because you can't live up to a standard that they themselves put on you, **YOU. ARE. NOT. WORTHLESS.**

I know it is cliché, but what matters on this earth is not what you are, but who. If you really, and I mean *really* think about it, a lot of the things we as humans do is only meant to fit a system designed to distract us from who we really are. What you are to your parents means just as little as the things you do to pass the time. 

However, those things are important in and out of themselves, for what value would life have without hobbies, goals and/or aspirations? Living up to your parent's standards has a funny way of making you live up to your own. The satisfaction you *may* get from living up to that potential will make you feel euphoric, powerful, and may even allow you to feel as if you have achieved something. 

It is, however, not everything. It will not give you what you are looking for, no matter how bad you may think it will. 

The thing that will bring you more satisfaction than any kind of personal idea about who you are supposed to be based on what everyone wants you to be, is by doing **WHAT YOU** want to do, and by becoming **WHO** you want to be. Not who your parents, friends, girlfriends, dogs, cats, birds (and yes, I mean both of them) want you to be, but who ***YOU*** want to be.

I come from a family of alcoholics. My grandfather was an entrepreneur who spent his entire life helping to build a small town in the middle of nowhere, away from the city and away from most of the things you and I know. He was a great man, and did a lot of great things. However, his son (my dad) could never live up to his potential. This ruined his entire life. Even now at the age of 59, he is constantly drinking and popping pills, and now has severe health problems. All because he couldn't live up to his own idea of who his family wanted him to be. 

Don't fall into the same trap. If your parents judge you for your life decisions, and for not being who they tried to make you, they were wrong from the start. Family should mean unconditional love, always, no matter what. That is why it is so important. 

The reason I am in this forum, right now, is because just about 10 months ago I lost one of the best friends I have ever had to suicide. When I had met him, it was my freshman year of high school. I was socially awkward, stereotypical and afraid. He took my friend group and I under his wing and made us feel comfortable. Something no one had ever managed to do.

Not even 4 months into our friendship, his father committed suicide. This absolutely destroyed him. Not only that, but he became someone that he wasn't. He had his own ideas about who he was and how he had let his father down. All of this was so untrue. Our pact became closer with the passing of his dad, because deep down we all knew what was going on. We never were able to foresee the decision that he made, because he hid it so well, but deep down we really did all know. So much that in the 6 years I knew him we never once talked about it. Not once.

The point is, don't let what you think you should be hinder you from who you are, because who you are is the only thing that matters. Trust me, your friends and family would definitely not be better off without you. Trust me. They wouldn't. There is not one thing I wouldn't give to just have 5 more minutes with my friend. To just tell him how much I looked up to him, and how much he has helped me in my adult life now, today. The saying is, you never really know what you have until it's gone. People are no different. You are not worthless. You are worth **EVERYTHING.**",,0.0,,2014-07-14 07:51:18,,,0,False,,,,0,,ciwva8s,,,,,t3_2amwqc,,,t1_ciwva8s,,,,t3_2amwqc,,,,,,,,1434705324.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

I have never really posted here before but I guess I'm just fed up with this curiosity I've been having lately. I am not really sure what ""suicidal"" really means or how far the definition goes. Would I ever jump off the roof or cut myself? No. But if for some reason I were to be dying or just dropped dead, I'd be happy with that. As much as everyone always argues against these things, it doesn't make sense to me why it is so unacceptable (probably not the best thing to say here). If you are miserable every single day of your life then why would you continue? The first argument most of you will go to is most likely, ""What about your family/people who care about you?"" First of all, I've been miserable quite some time now while everyone around me is happy. Does that make me happy? No, so why would it make me upset if for one moment I was happy while they were sad? Secondly, I am admittedly selfish about all of this. I am the one who is upset and needs help or craves attention or whatever the situation is. I would be doing it for the sake of myself.  Don't get too worried about me. I'm not going anywhere. I'm just curious as I find myself thinking about this more and more lately.

Yes, I am gay but that is another story and another time. I have a lot of problems lately and nobody to talk about them with so I was hoping you all could help me out with that since it seems like you do a lot of that and help a lot of people. Sorry for droning on like that.

She has kids and for the better part of a year this carried on being lovers, playing house, etc. Then a guy she was interested in but never has time for her, wanted to try and make time. And she dumped me and broke my heart. I've continued on living there...and after that guy broke her heart and she single she doesn't want to be anything more then friends.

I keep trying to tell her...that I can't be just friends. I can't go out to the bar and watch her take someone how, or flirt with other guys. I don't want to be in that situation but if I leave I'll be leaving her financially vulenrable. Ie she can't afford the place without me. So now  I gotta choose between letting down the woman I love down.

And then I've tried moving on somedays are better then others. She doesn't care for me the way I care for her. I'm in love with her, and yet no woman can replace her.

I'm stuck in this stupid loop, I love her, she doesn't love me, I can never replace her. Everytime I go out with another girl, she seems drab and timid in comparison. 

I've gotten low, real low a couple of times and tried to work up the adrenaline to end my pain. Just ended up scarring my arms with hesitation marks.

I just want this all to end. I'm never going to be able to replace her, I'm nearly 30 and I have no family to speak of, I tired of trying I just want to curl up in a ball and feel nothing.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,self,"I need someone to talk too, and I feel too awkward to call a hotline...",14,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1fva7u/i_need_someone_to_talk_too_and_i_feel_too_awkward/,

I love making jokes and posting hilariously retarded comments on Nintendo game threads. I feel like I should voice my true feelings on reddit now. 

I'm in my senior year of high school. Ever since I've entered High school, I've been failing Math. My studies have been equally shared. I've almost failed Math the first semester (76%), huh... Maybe I could put more effort into it. I did. 40% of my study time on Math among six subjects. End result? 77. One fucking percent. I barely passed the first year. I barely passed the second. Here I am now, with a 72. My parents have been honors students, they tried teaching me. If that didn't work, Math majors. Nothing helps.

I hate failure. I detest it so much. I cheated by copying homework, and both our parents were called. I'm so pathetic I got someone else in trouble for failing. I have no friends anymore, because I keep trying to understand trig. Sine, Cosine, Tan, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant. I can't even remember a single value, or what each would even mean.

In which case the ability to harm another was in you in the first place and the porn kind of just showed you a way to do it. I have no idea how it can be harmful unless you participated in the act of making the porn and it resulted in people being hurt physically, mentally or emotionally.

Also, I guess there is the argument that watching porn drives demand to create the content, but content that has already been created, or not created with the intent of profit-making does not really have that apply...

At any rate I don't think what you enjoy watching makes you a bad person. Everyone's brain is shaped differently based on genetics and environmental factors, so of course everyone's tastes are going to be different. Who cares if it's not what everyone watches. I mean hell, people watch people have sex with animal costumes on, or sticking octopi up their asses, etc. (okay that one might hurt the animal).

As far as rejection from women...

Ever watched 40 year old virgin? The last thing you want to do is think your life depends on a relationship and going out there with no idea how to approach women. In my opinion, to ""get"" women, to form a relationship, etc. simply requires one to understand people!

So don't focus on getting a woman in your life, focus on improving your own life to where you are confident in your own accomplishments, and relationships will evolve from friendships that you form naturally over time!

I will be leaving out a few attributes simply because it is too hard to think or write about and they do not impact the initial story anyways.

I was born into a somewhat loving family, but a poor asian family. I grew up a specific way which was that in order to succeed in life, you have to be the best at whatever you do. Well, I followed this advice and it's gotten me everything, but what I wanted. I used to be the perfect student and son up until the 5th grade where I realized that my dad always wanted more from me. He would always compare me to other children who were more perfect in his eyes. I was never good enough for him. What is the point of getting A's if my only rewards were yelling from my own dad? From there, I pretty much gave up trying to be the academic savior for the family. The typical response from parents if their child received bad grades were pretty much what I ended up getting up until the freshman year of college. College was pretty much the same in regards to my dad and my interaction with my peers. My dad promised to tone down the yelling if I did my job and got A's. That was total bullshit. All that I got from my hard work was yelling and a ""good job"" pat from my teachers who only give a shit about me because I'm funding their salary with my tuition.

Throughout my lifetime, I can honestly say that I have never had a true friend that was friends with me because they wanted to be friends with me. There was always some reason on why a person wanted to befriend me or have a conversation with me. For example, all the girls that I have ever came in contact with have only spoken to me because I offer some sort of service, whether it would be that I can easily do their math homework or I had lunch money. To this day, I have never seen relationships be different than what I am saying right now.

Some of you who are actually reading this may ask, what did I use to cope with this? I used the only resource I could, video games and the internet. I began using the internet around 1998-1999 where Road Runner used to be the major ISP &amp; cable provider in my region. I instantly loved it as it was a way to meet other people through things like AIM or Starcraft. Though, the internet has changed for the worse. I've gradually noticed the amount of toxicity within the internet and it sickens me. It reminds me of the plague that is society. I used to be able to use the internet and video games as a release, now I can no longer do that.

I've developed many personas because of my issues with my dad and my issues with the internet, specifically towards video games. My first persona was being the chill, down to earth asian dude you could talk and play with, but this persona no longer satisfies me. No one cares about an asian dude who is good at everything, or almost everything. All people care about nowadays is whether you are famous, efamous, or a cute girl playing games. This is when I developed my second and main persona over the internet, being this so called cute white girl. Although I am still living a lie, it makes me happy and unhappy at the same time because I ended up getting what I want, but at the same time I don't. I could never be a streamer under this persona. I could never develop a relationship under this persona.

Everyone tells me things will get better. I call bullshit on that. I have changed myself many different times, it always ends up the same way. I am unhappy because people either ignore me, use me, or treat me like shit. Why should I be nice to people who are not nice to me?

21701,,False,spinozavoid,,,,"Thank you so much for your reply and great advice. I agree that identifying that there is a problem and seeing a counselor is one of the first things someone with depression and suicidal tendencies should do. 

I am lucky in that my parents are very supportive, especially my mom, who has been extremely depressed to the point that she almost didn't marry my Dad because she was convinced she was only going to kill herself anyway. 

One huge benefit of that is that she had pushed me to go to a therapist when I was 11 and missed a year of school for health reasons. I now have a long standing, and very understanding, therapist who knows a lot about my history with out my needing to repeat it. I am on medication, Wellbutrin, and have tried various SSRI's in the past. 

Its hard because I have started the ""recovery path"" about six years ago now and have had very little relief from any sort of suicidal feelings. I know I should avoid the word ""always,"" because things *could* get better, but it feels sometimes like whats plaguing me isn't always depression, but some sort of existential fog where I just can't live functionally. I mind the depression part, but that fog is what gives me some sort of depth and complexity and I don't know if I want to lose it. I'd rather die with that complexity than be flatlined. 

Right now, a bout of major depression is subsiding and I can get out of bed sometimes and do the things I need to do. But I'm always leaving that door open for depression by letting the idea of suicide stay valid. I don't know how to change that without drastically changing who I am. I can't imagine myself as anything different from this because I have only had brief moments where I was glad my attempts  to kill myself had failed. But at least I've had those moments.

I really appreciate your reply and I am so sorry that you have felt suicidal too. I've been trying to stay as positive as I can in these replies because negativity is alienating and I really do want you to know that your advice is quality. Its just hard when you have tried so much but it seems as though its in your nature to fall back on suicide. 

I hope you are doing well now. I think one of the hardest parts of recovery is when things are relatively normal and you can function - so your focus changes from being on this major depression to littler more nuanced parts of life that your depression hid. I know a lot of my friends who are recovering addicts have felt that way around the two year mark of sobriety. I'm not sure, but your reply sounded like that might be where you are at and I'm happy for you for getting the help you needed and dealing with life. I know very well how hard that is to do. 

Best wishes for your therapy. I am so sorry your parents have remained in denial about something that was hard enough for you to accept on your own. It sounds like you already know this well, but your depression is real and its not your fault. Again, good luck and thanks for taking the time to reply to me.

I suffer from depression and alcoholism. Im pretty sure i suffer from bipolar disorder and social anxiety too. All of these run in my family. Honestly ive already planned out how im going to kill myself. Ill kill myself with carbon monoxide poisoning in my car when the time comes since its pretty much painless and id just fall asleep and never wake up. Im just waiting until the time comes before i actually do it. Right now im 33 years old. Ive set the goal that if im 40 and still feel the same that im going to kill myself. I guess im a patient suicidal person. Ive already made a half assed attempt to kill myself a few years ago when my marriage ended. Ive got the scars on my writs and arms to prove it. Ive never thought that id be selfish enough to kill myself but i know that if ive been miserable long enough that i will do it. Im very lonely. I think thats what a lot of it is. I havent been able to get over my wife cheating on me and get into a relationship. Part of it is that i know that i cant go thru all that again. I cant be hurt like that again because i know that if i did id just fucking kill myself. I almost did the first time i got hurt so what would stop me from actually killing myself if it happened again? Im actually terrified to go thru that again because of what i felt the first time i got hurt.
Im very reluctant to get help for this. For one thing im a very private person(thats why im writing this on here). Also im afraid about what affect it would have on my everyday life. I have a job where this would really affect it. Ive stopped pursuing certain jobs because i knew that they would find out about this during the interview process and eliminate me from consideration.  I really dont want to kill myself because i know that it would ruin the lives of all of my loved ones but eventually you get to the point where you cant handle all the stress anymore. Im reluctant to get professional help for my problems since im very private and selective on who i tell my feelings to. But at the same time i realize that in order for me to avoid killing myself i someday need to tell someone about my true feelings. Im I really dont know what to do. I really dont want to kill myself but at the same time i figure that if im going to be miserable for the rest of my life then why should i keep suffering thru it?

But these feelings pass after a short while and you will realize you have more people that actually care for you than you first thought. When you get depressed, your emotions take over, cloud your mind, and make you think about irrational things.

I suggest calling that chick back tomorrow, or perhaps the next day, to see how she is doing. You are interested in her, right? Show her you are by talking to her.

But, have you ever considered the possibility that you have a very real chemical imbalance that is causing you to think abstractly about the reality of your situation?  Or perhaps an undiagnosed mental condition that could give you a better understanding about yourself.  I'm not a doctor, so I don't know what's best for you, but being so apathetic about life and everything doesn't seem normal.  In saying that, there's nothing wrong with having these problems.  We're just products of our genetics and our upbringing, sometimes one more than the other.

Everyone here is talking about the selfishness aspect, but nobody is talking about the alternatives to the problem.

Are they prescribing you anything at the clinic, and are you taking it?  There is a very real possibility that with proper treatment you could actually -want- to live.  What if the problem isn't that you don't have a problem, but that you don't realize what the problem is yet.

Nobody who is legitimately happy wants to kill themselves, and if you're not happy then something must be wrong or lacking.  You're lacking something that could make you happy.  You said you tried to find something to make you happy.  I don't doubt the effort with which you tried, but just because you haven't found it yet doesn't mean you won't some day.  16 is pretty young to think you've got it all figured out, and I hope that doesn't sound like I'm judging you for being so young.  I just think that's a legitimately short amount of time to decide 'Nope, this sucks, I'm out of here'.

Notice how I haven't mentioned the other people in your life till now.  It's not about them, it's about you.  Don't worry about them.  Worry about yourself.. but ask if, at 16 years old, you've really experienced enough to know whether or not you should be making such a big decision.  Have the humility, especially if you're willing to be honest enough with yourself to stare death in the face, to know that it's alright to be lost for a while.  You don't have to have life figured out, you don't even have to be happy right away.  You don't have to live to make other people happy either.  It's all about you, if that's how you want to wing it.

Life is all about figuring it out, and EVERYBODY is winging it.

What saved me was realizing that if I give it a real shot, be honest with myself, and still want out when I've exhausted every option and am too tired to keep going, I've got that option.  It's my choice then, but not before I've tried every path to happiness.",,0.0,,2013-03-04 08:36:49,,,0,False,,,,0,,c8pets8,,,,,t3_19l3td,,,t1_c8pets8,,,,t3_19l3td,,,,,,,,1431476676.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

126619,,True,sheapeaks,,,,"I might be able to offer some insight in relation to your husband.  You are probably right that he doesn't completely understand how serious you are. Denial is a very natural human response, and it is extremely difficult to accept that someone you love and care about is in real danger. My best friend attempted suicide this summer.  She had not talked to me about suicide specifically, but we talked all the time and I knew she was having an extremely rough time with depression for a variety of terrible things that had recently happened in her life.  The thought that she might try to kill herself may have briefly crossed my mind, but in retrospect I realize that I dismissed it because I couldn't bring myself to think that permanently losing her was a real possibility. 
I cared about her so much, and I was extremely distraught and worried, but I don't think she knew how affected I was by her suffering. I didn't want her to know how upset and worried about her I was because I didn't want her to feel bad about it, and I felt like she needed me to be strong. I don't think she fully understands how much she means to me, because I wanted to help her more than anything in the world, but was unsure of how to do it. It is a little bit difficult to imagine how I would feel if she was gone, but she is the most important thing in the world to me and I think if I lost her I would break. Often times, people care about you more than you realize.
One of the hardest things about tough times like these is that at the time, it feels like it will never end, but know that it can get better! My friend I was talking about is doing MUCH better now. One thing that especially helped was that she went to therapy at Four Winds Hospital, and said that it absolutely changed her life.

Getting your thoughts out to a complete stranger is not only cathartic, it helps to hear an outsider's perspective on what you're dealing with (someone that has probably heard the same story as yours and mine 1000 times).

If you are not adverse to it- read the Bible. Read Psalms. Some Psalms (like Psalm 56) are very comforting in times of depression and trouble.

Fall back on your friends and family. The ones that stick with you during this time are your real friends. If you don't have close friends or family, find someone who has been through this- someone older and shadow them. Learn how they dealt with it.

Learn from your mistakes. Your ex left another man to be with you. That is usually a warning sign that a woman will eventually leave you for someone else. Now you know. Avoid cheaters in future relationships.

Change things up. You probably did things the same way for awhile when you were with your ex. Move the furniture around. Change the decorations. Do the things your ex hated that you changed just for her. Take walks and do the other things you really enjoy in life. Avoid depressing movies- or 'divorce porn' such as tv shows and movies that glorify divorce or breakups.

Help others. When you get wrapped up in being there for others that are hurting, you have less time to hurt yourself.

Little about myself. I'm 26 years old, male. I've been depressed for most of my life, I just never talked about it cause I don't want people to worry and I don't wanna get all brainwashed by prescribed medication. 

I don't really like my family, my Dad's really old-fashioned. The type of guy whose never said I love you and hunts and all that stuff and sports, pretty much the exact opposite of me. My mom is just kinda there, she's said she loves me, but I really don't keep in contact. My younger brother works at this really successful law firm and brings home like 300k a year, he's really smart and was pretty much the ideal child growing up.

Me, I basically went right to work after high school. I barely passed and didn't have plans to go to college, it'd be too hard and a waste of money. I work at Mcdonalds right now, it sucks dick. I work the graveyard shifts, which are really lonely and all you do is clean and restock. 

My housing arrangements suck. I live with 6 other people, my friends, who also work at Mcdonalds in a two bedroom one bathroom shithole that was once a former meth house. There's a big dog that lives with us and a couple of cats, always running around and leaving hair everywhere. The place is a literal pigsty, last time someone mopped or vacummed was probably over a month. 

I'm also overweight, 5ft 9in and 262 pounds. The main issue is that we're so poor that all we eat is cheap fast food or processed snacks from walmart and lost of mountain dew. I don't excessive, too tired and my hobbies only consist of magic the gathering and League of Legends. Needless to say, its pretty much a recipe for disaster.

Another source of why I'm doing this is the non-existant state of my love life. I've never kissed a girl, held one's hand, or even gotten the nerve up to ask one out. I'm introverted and its a house full of guys. Needless to say its not an ideal resume for my love life. I've kinda accepted I will be alone, its just who I am. I don't like other people.

Anywhom, here's what I've decided. I'm going to kill myself, obviously. and wanted to do something fun on my last day. So, I saved up the little amount of money I could and plan on buying a oneway ticket to San Diego and a ticket to Comic-con 2014, and a hotel somewhere. 

Whatever day it is, I plan on going to the convention. I've never been and I've always wanted to go, just to see what it's like. I figure I'll do some stuff and then go to the highest point of the convention center, then jump off and kill myself. Obviously, I'm not going to land on people, I'll probably yell or find a remote area and then jump. I figure it'll draw some attention, and I'll always be remembered by people.

I just thought I'd share that with you, I really don't think I'll change my mind and I've thought about this a lot.

Are you still lifting? When my sister died about two years ago, I went to the gym 4 times weekly and it was a big part of what picked me up from my lowest ebb. 

&gt;Please help me get out. What can I do to end my life with the least amount of damage on the loves of those around me?

The answer is to go to a doctor and get professional help. You can only have one of the things you want, not both. The reason your death will hurt the people around you is because they love you for who you are, and there's no way to take that away from them gently.

So you have a choice: you can choose to die, or you can choose to endure. It's your life.

738,,True,ClaranceWhirly,,,,"Hey throwaway - first off let me say that while you may not think you have any reason to be depressed that does not mean the feelings you are having are not overwhelming or legitimate so try and be a little easier on yourself so you don't fall in to a cycle where you are angry with yourself for being depressed which causes you to feel even more depressed... and angry... and on and on and on. 

I understand the crash effect and the feeling that there is no escape from depression and while you may be correct in your thinking I believe you might benefit from stepping back and realizing that while there may not be a cure for depression there is a more positive (or maybe less negative) way to deal with this illness.  Overcoming depression isn’t quick or easy but it’s far from impossible. You can’t beat it through sheer willpower, but you do have some control over how you deal with these feelings as they crop up.  Try and be aware that they are completely normal and valid and while yes, it would be an easier life if they weren't present this is just who you are and who you may always be so try not to be so hard on yourself when the inevitable crash occurs.  

You may need to make a conscious effort to ensure that you are making positive choices for yourself each day - start with a few small goals and slowly build from there.Take things one day at a time and reward yourself for each accomplishment. The steps may seem small, but they’ll quickly add up.  And I know that in these times it can feel like you are walking through quicksand and you may have to force yourself to get motivated but for all the energy you put into your recovery, you’ll get back much more in return.

Also make sure and share what you’re going through with the people you love and trust; ask for the help and support you need. You may have retreated from your most of your relationships in these 'crashed' times but you took a brave step posting your story here and there are plenty of caring, compassionate, empathetic and sympathetic subscribers to this subreddit that would like nothing more than to help get you through the tough times so vent away, we're listening.

And I understand where you are coming from wondering what the point of living a capricious life is but sometimes in life you have to consciously make it a point to make yourself feel worthwhile. You may be discounting the emotional fulfillment that making it a point to be a genuinely worthwhile member of society can evoke.  You are not a drain on society if you are giving back at least as much as you are taking.

My family will be dead, my friends now will have their own lives, and I will most likely have nothing to declare from my life.

Hello Reddit
Since there is nobody there for me, I figured that IF anything can help me, than I can find help on the internet. 

I am currently 15 (2 weeks away from 16th Birthday) and already sick of life. I have reached a point in my life, from where I don't wish to continue. Basicly, let me tell you of my life 4 years ago:

My entire life was going well, I was at a FANTASTIC school where almost everybody knew me, I literally had more friends than I can recall today. My Results at School where better then ever, and I'm not really a person who learned for school overall, I had the best time of my life. At some point I became so good at school that I was allowed to go to a school where I would be able to have a MUCH better graduation (german school system)

So I did that. I changed school and left everybody behind... And that was the biggest mistake of my life. I knew nobody at that school. I never really got bullied, there were only some people making fun of me. From this day, I started falling apart. It didn't take very long until I was a wreck. But the school wasn't everything that destroyed me. I was interested in girls long before any other boy, and I always wanted to be in a relationship. I wanted someone who truly loved me. I always dreamt of such someone. But in reality, every girl I ever tried it with not only rejected me, but also made fun of me, insulted me, or fool me into believing that she loved me. Soon this became a thing to many pretty girls from my school and from where I live, to fool me, and to make me feel like the worthless garbage I am today. There was one girl that fooled around with me for the past 2 years she never insulted me or anything, she just pretended to love me. I felt into deep depression everytime she had a boyfriend again. The past 4 years I had nobody to talk to. I know I have my family, and I love them, but believe me, they just are not the type of person who you can talk to about this stuff, and believe me, even if they share my blood, flesh and bones, I could never open up to them. The only person I still KNEW was a girl I knew since Kindergarten and who went to school with me until I left. And I literaly just asked her If I could talk about everything with her... And she said no. She said she had her own problems and all. I think she is mad at me because I ""left"" her back 4 years ago, since she pretty much was in the same position I am now for her entire life. I see and regret that today. So afterall I was more alone than ever. Back in the last few weeks before my current summerbreak I came closer to a girl in my class who is about the same age as me, let's call her Rose, since she has a tattoo of a rose my brother made (strange coincidence). So Rose was basically a girl version of me. She REALLY was into videogames, we shared the same humor, whe both tried to kill ourselves and failed. But somehow I never fell in love with her. For the first time of my Life I met a girl that liked me, and I didn't love her, even though she was the ""perfect girlfriend"" I always dreamt off. The only difference between us was that she had a boyfriend. So Rose and I chatted for hours each day. For the first time after all theese years I was finally able to... Talk about my feelings, my fears my dark side, my life. As I mentioned above, I currently have my 6-week long hollydays and am in the 3rd week. Rose was somewhere in Italy with her Boyfriend. Since she is my only friend I was alone the past 3 weeks... I mean ALONE I was sitting in my room, sometimes went to the restroom or the kitchen, and that's is. I never even saw a single human beeing for the last 3 weeks. (My Parents aren't at home, the will return tomorrow.) So Rose came back a few days ago and I decided to bring her the Computer Components she wanted to buy from me. So since my Bike was broken I descided to walk 14km to bring the stuff to her. But now her Boyfriend is amazingly jealous and doesn't want her to chat, speak or meet up with me. She said she is sorry but her boyfriend is just more important than me. 

I don't know what to do anymore... Everytime something good happens in my life, it get's taken away again. She was the best friend I ever had and now she doesn't give a fuck about me and bails on me just like anybody else. Even though I never loved her as a partner of a relationship, I loved her as a friend, as a sister from another familiy... I really am suicidal right now. The pressure is just too much.

20707,,True,SolInvictus,,,,"First of all, you need to get yourself out of your negative state of mind. It isn't helping you. When you're negative, you tend to lose sight of opportunities and refuse to pursue them out of pessimism. This tends to screw you pretty hard. 

Secondly, it is as soniabegonia said, you don't know what the rest of your life will be like. Think about how lucky you are for having someone who cares about you as much as your girlfriend. If you had ended your life years ago, you wouldn't have ever gotten to know her. You're not a psychic (nobody is), so you can't predict what the future will bring. You're just setting yourself up for failure with a self-fulfilling prophecy by thinking you know how badly the future will turn out.

Look, I've gone through my whole life alternating between states of depression, mania and even occasional anxiety (which is the worst feeling, let me tell you) but not once have I given up hope. I'm glad for the times when I can think straight and be happy and have things work out for me. When things don't work out the way I'd want them to, I don't just collapse and fold. I take a step back, consider what I'm going through, reevaluate my expectations and move on from there. You should do the same.

Consider your situation: you believe that you're down on your luck, you're feeling depressed and you think that your life is going nowhere. Try to reevaluate your thoughts on the concept of living. Life, just like everything else, is relative. It is in a constant state of flux. In truth, your life can't become ""better"", and it can't become ""worse"" because these concepts are nothing more than subjective, arbitrary values. Simply reevaluate your expectations of happiness and you will know happiness. I know that it's easier said than done, but it's the truth. 

If for instance, you think that the only way for you to be happy is to be rich, then you'll always be sad if you don't have money. Those who live for materialistic desires are seldom happy people, because just being rich is never enough. There's always something more than they want to maintain their happiness. You have to be content and treasure all that you have in order to be happy. If you manage to get a good job and earn a good salary, consider it a bonus to an already good life. The same goes for those people who feel lonely without successful relationships: you have to first be happy and content with yourself. The romance is a lovely bonus to an already fulfilled life. How can you love another if you can't even find a way to love yourself, right? 

Love your life, and go on living.

First of all, I am so sorry to hear you're having a tough time... I don't know how much help my words will be to you, but I want you to know that you are a stellar, kind, devoted physician and your patients would be devastated (at least) if you decide to make the decision... the wrong decision.

I really want to help you with your trans identity. I think it was incredibly brave that you went out with your friend in that setting. The people who abused you in the past... please try not to think of them too much. They are just ignorant of the concept of transgender. They may see it as an 'aberration' of nature, but they just don't know any better about the condition. I don't really even want to call it a 'condition'... I don't know you very well, but I do see a kind heart with much to give to this world. Of course, I realise that in the end, it is your life, and you have the right to decide for yourself what would make you happy. That being said I want to strongly urge you to really think about everything, think about all the people who love you, think about how many lives you have touched...

The road to chronic happiness may not be an easy road to walk, and it will take a lot of effort on your part to make things work with your gender identity, among other difficulties. But I do believe you have more than what it takes to come out on top of all this adversity that you've faced. You just have to repeat to yourself and try to convince yourself, ""I love every part of myself"" every single day, many many times if you need to.

Anyway, if you ever need someone to talk to, I am here. (Incidentally, I am also considering medicine as a future career path... perhaps you can be my mentor!)

Stay well! =)

P.S. if you want to refer to yourself as feminine pronouns, that is totally fine with us.",,0.0,,2013-07-11 07:39:48,,,0,1373525207,,,,0,,cb0ae1a,,,,,t3_1hyp9d,,,t1_cb0ae1a,,,,t3_1hyp9d,,,,,,,,1430508606.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

80963,,True,JomaxZ,,,,"If you're ever interested in trying meditation again (for me, I didn't get properly interested until my life was a complete shambles and I felt totally out of control), I'd just recommend learning how to do it properly (so that the awareness practice is actually a disciplined practice) and doing it every day (as part of the discipline, it requires regular practice) -- however, it could be done for five minutes or ten (or five 2x a day), etc.  Practicing staying present even for a few minutes is more than many people consciously do.

In reflecting back on my life, I realized many other times when I was ""accidentally"" drawn into being present -- teaching people how to learn to juggle (I juggle ... it's a thing :-P), overseeing little children, working with the elderly -- often out on long runs my mind stops going other places and I'm drawn right to where I am -- (I ran the Chicago Marathon once, and that was 5 hours of being present, and except for the difficulty, it was really, really enjoyable).  I've just noticed that my depression, anxiety, heartbreak, etc. have been fires fueled by *not staying present* ... i.e. running away with my thoughts and feelings, entertaining all the dark thoughts and letting them pull me down into the pits where they'd jab me with pokers, so to speak.  But getting lost in those thoughts about despair only hurts if you're actually lost in the thoughts ... so, anyway, practicing presence for me is starting to heal a lot of the wounds I've experienced and inflicted upon myself in the past because of reacting to situations (and reacting badly, so to speak).  Anyway, end that rant for now.  I could rant about that for awhile, but I also realize that I wouldn't want anyone to do something they weren't joyful about -- I'm kind of just hoping that something that has worked for me might spark some joy in you / others struggling with stuff.

[That said, any number of practices can be meditative (if one is practicing the focused awareness) : walking, reading, writing, doing art, playing music, performance (probably anything) -- but the practice is observing if your awareness wanders anywhere but what you are focusing on, and intentionally drawing your awareness back for the length of the practice.  And of course, everyone is aware much of the time, but they might not recognize that that is what they are doing and realize the benefits that they experience from being aware because they don't know what they don't know...]

&gt;I kept repeating in my head “shit happens, shit happens, shit happens” while gritting my teeth to not cry.

This sounds like a shitty thing to go through.  Crying is a little like vomiting in that right before you do it, you feel worse and worse, but the actual doing of it, and afterwards feels amazing.  Some of my worst experiences came in situations where I tried to force myself not to cry or I was unable to.  

&gt;He came round and gave me a few 20mg Oxycontin pills. I’d never seen or heard of them before and opiates are something I’d never experienced, so had no idea what to expect. He said just chew one up and give it a half hour, then he went home. Whatever, I did as he said and munched the bitter thing down and went back to staring at my computer. When it hit me, it was amazing. It was like that feeling you’d get as a small child running to a parent for a hug. It was that feeling, wrapping itself around my body and overwhelming me with feelings of safety, security, and optimism. I went to bed that night feeling completely at peace, with no more nightmares – only magical, beautiful dreams.

Thankfully my drugs of choice have only ever been food / sugar, TV, and porn.  I had morphine twice when I had two surgeries as a 9 year old -- and holy shit!  It is like everything in the world is perfect and happy and bliss.  That is some scary shit to give to a 9 year old; knowing you can feel like that.  I wonder what that did to me...

Anyway, my mom has been a narcotics addict off and on since she was 9 herself (ah, they did things a bit differently back in the 50s) -- her doctor gave her mom a big bottle of Darvon (a mild opioid, still addictive with some nasty potential side-effects) to use as a general pain killer, telling her ""don't worry, it's non-habit forming"").  She has since upped her own medication many times over -- still takes a lot now for chronic pain, but does not seem to be needing more and more, so her management is ""okay"" -- but at some point, nigh two decades ago, she checked into a clinic for issues related to narcotic abuse and she was going to NA meetings.  Anyway, she's never really healed as a person and it has taken quite a toll.

&gt;Realising that someone so similar to me and so close socially could get to that point struck me like a bolt of icey lightning.

This does sound scary.  I've never known anyone personally who has ended their own life, but I've known some people who have made symbolic gestures about wishing they were dead.  And I've met lots of people who have known folks who suicided.  I'm sorry it hit you like it did.  This is just me, but I've had this sense of knowing my whole life (even in the darkest places I've gotten to), that no matter how bad it would get, I would never end myself.  Partially out of morbid curiosity (""what happens next""?), maybe out of an installed fear response (""what would happen if I did that?""), and largely out of this sense that I'd experienced life being wonderful and a trust that I could figure out how to get back to that place internally.  But anyway, I knew that wanting to be done with life and being willing to do it myself were different things, but what I felt was still very scary.

&gt;Mum convinced me to give uni a chance, but after 3 weeks I quit.

If you read any of my other older posts to people, you'll see that forcing myself through school was probably the most painful thing I've experienced.  I learned some things (in classes and just by the experience of forcing myself to do something I was hating so much), but I'm glad when people give themselves the freedom to not force them to do something that is torturing them.  I imagine with your anxiety and depression, trying to do four years at Uni would have been challenging.  If someone is on fire with wanting to learn or do something, then they will thrive and succeed at the doing of it.

72,,True,[deleted],,,,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I've attempted before due to my undiagnosed ADD and high-functioning autism as well as the deaths of my grandmother, whom was the only relative who understood me, my grandfather, whom I spoke to daily, and my best friend causing me to develop severe depression with a nice dose of self loathing. I have some experiance in psych meds, and while I don't pretend to know what you're exactly feeling, I hope you will hear me out. 

First of all the pills and vodka thing is going to end really badly. If you fail to kill yourself you'll get anything from a severe headache and stomach ache to painful chronic disease of the liver to a brain injury if you have a stroke or some other sort of oxygen depravation.  If you do give yourself liver failure, you will die slowly and painfully over several days. My cousin, an ICU nurse, told me that most people who die this way have changed their minds about suicide only to find it too late. I don't mean to be so grim, but I think people need to know that most suicide methods are actually really grim. 

Second- Don't let them bully you about meds.  If they don't work, go to another doctor if this one is too lazy and/or unprofessional to listen to you. Keep in mind that antidepressants can take up to 3 weeks to work though. If its less that 3 weeks, you may only feel worse because you expect it to work and it isn't. Many meds work in different ways. For example, Concerta is the only ADD medication that remotely works for me. 

Are you sure you're not ADD? Also, some forms of high functioning autism cause people to struggle with either algebra or geometry or both. Autistics tend to be brighter than their NT counterparts, so you may have been able to compensate for years. I did. Autism is not a disease-it's actually a ""painful gift"", a neuroprofile that brings great gifts. But then again I don't know if you are or not. Your algebra comment sounded so familiar though. 

Some more food for thought: the average person lives to be 72.  That means your life is still in its first half and statistically speaking you probably have not yet: had the best day, met your greatest love, heard your favorite song, read the best book, met your best friend, etc. And if you keep with med school you will have a great future.

Your body is absolutely overwhelmed with hormones right now.  Believe it or not, you're actually going to feel better about this in a few weeks.  I'm in no way saying you'll be ""over"" it or any crap like that, just that you'll be able to think a little more clearly about all of this.  

As a few others have said, get second and third opinions.  You didn't share your diagnosis, but in most cases, it would be close to impossible for a doctor to give you a definitive ""You can never have children"" after a mere half hour appointment.  

I'm not trying to invalidate you, but you're only 19.  It's very likely that you still haven't found anything else that you feel you were made for, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  All through my teens, I had my heart set on a specific career.  It was my life, my dream, it was me.  And, well, due to life, it was completely swept away.  It's not a complete impossibility for me, but it's just not realistic anymore.  I've mourned that loss many times over, but I've also discovered that there are quite a few other things that I could happily do for the rest of my life.  Keep in mind - **I'm not trying to say that you're like me, or that this isn't a devastating, crushing event.**  However, to assume that you have nothing more in life is shortsighted.  

I know taking care of yourself is probably the hardest thing when you feel like this, but it sounds like you have some progress yet to get yourself stable.

111899,,True,AZskyeRX,,,,"in undergrad i was severely depressed. i was struggling academically for the first time in my life and thought it meant i was stupid and not cut out for college. i had never had a serious relationship and thought it meant i was defective. all of my friends had failed out or left school and i literally had no friends at my school and my best friend was at school across the country. i was partying on the weekends with a group of ""friends"" who were interested mostly in how generous i was when high and how frequently i had public sex with embarrassing partners. i felt i was letting down my parents and former teachers. i now know i was also suffering severe depression and had been since high school. i had a history of cutting and stealing pills. i was good at putting on my ""good girl"" face and convincing everyone i had my life under control. i didn't. i got to the point that i started to drive my car off a very winding road. when i hit the gravel and started to spin, i was suddenly and unexpectedly terrified of dying. i didn't want to die, i just wanted to escape my life and my failures. nothing really happened because i had good brakes and the car stopped about 4 feet from the dropoff. i didn't get help at that point and wrote it off as an accident from being overtired. my drug use went up and my grades kept going down. my best friend finally figured out that something major was wrong and asked me point blank if i was suicidal. when i said yes and told her about the car incident, she started crying and stayed on the phone, begging me to get help, until i walked over to campus health and the receptionist told her where i was. i didn't take any meds, i didn't have more than 3 sessions with an amazing therapist, but i did finally face that i was going to be hurting more than myself. i'm a doormat for my friends and family, which is good or bad depending on the person and how they feel about me. in this case, it meant i didn't want to hurt anyone and couldn't bring myself to commit suicide. i also think my father's comments about dealing with his father's suicide, and an incident in high school where i had to talk down a friend from suicide helped me see the hurt i would cause. so i focused on school and just getting my work done. i quit the drugs and dropped the ""friends.""  i got lucky and the next year had roommates who decided i was their friend whether i wanted to be or not, and they drug me out of my shell. i managed to survive with 2 degrees and am now wrapping up grad school. i even (by some miracle i don't understand) kept my scholarship the whole time. i'd love to say everything was magically better. it wasn't. grad school has been insanely hard and i ended up in an emotionally abusive relationship for the last 4 years. a year ago i found out a dear friend had killed herself and was nearly inconsolable for a couple days. my mother (who hates psychiatry) begged me to go to the school counselor. i was suicidal again this summer when the emotional abuse really peaked and school was at its hardest. the only things that pulled me through are supportive family, a few really good friends who my ex couldn't run off, and a certain amount of stubbornness. i realized, as i was facing failing a class, that i could give up and fail even bigger, or i could do everything in my power to not fail this class and at least take pride in that. i got lucky and squeaked by. the biggest shift after undergrad was realizing that being afraid of failure was screwing me up worse than the failure itself. i kept thinking, if i fail this then i'll fail that next thing, and it became self-fulfilling. i have to avoid thinking of myself as ""a failure"" and instead accept that failure happens and it means i either try again or try something new. i'm facing graduation, a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt, no current job prospects, and no relationship to lean on. it is terrifying. but i am focusing on what i can control today, not tomorrow. today, i can study and plan to take a vacation and pay my bills and laugh about the guy on IAM who has two dicks. i'll worry about tomorrow when it gets here. whether that approach works for you or not, i can tell you from multiple points of view (impromptu crisis counselor, suicidal person, friend of a completed suicide) that suicide is a pretty shitty answer to failure. i know quite a few homeless people who have never given up to that point. i think it is the ultimate failure. i mean, you're literally failing at life. i'd rather succeed at being a stubborn bitch and maintaining breathing.",,0.0,,2014-01-04 07:18:19,,,0,False,,,,0,,cegz9uo,,,,,t3_1udioh,,,t1_cegz9uo,,,,t3_1udioh,,,,,,,,1431792881.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

Well, if you are and if you aren't (although is sounds like how we grew up I want to write you a letter).

Dear (I will leave your name out),

I'm sorry that we never spoke much to each other while we grew up and there are some things I wanted to tell you.  Thank you for being one of the only people in my life that didn't abuse me.  I remember when you used to play video games and let me watch.  Hell, you still play video games.  Life has been a crazy road.  I have struggled with depression and, at one point, substances.  I found it hard to cope even when I was nine.  I can remember contemplating suicide then.  When I was 9 you were 12.  I think our mom is either a person who is seriously sick in head, or a sane *bad and immoral person* in every aspect.  The abuse was hidden for so long, but I know now that we all knew then.  I am sorry I wasn't a stronger sister not to let mom beat you or take your clothes outside claiming you were kicked out for no reason.  I'm also sorry that we had to live with someone who seemed not only to prostitute, but, at times, enjoy it.

I need to tell you something serious that I was talking someone about.  I would like to keep this out of my head because I break down in tears every time I think about it, and I hesitate to speak about it in some public forum, but I feel it needs to be heard.  

I know that mother molested me and sometimes would let her ""boyfriends"" in on it.  I know it happened to our sister too.  If they were just molesting me by themselves without her, she would try to blackmail them for more money and it made me feel like my abuse was more like her turning tricks with her kids.  After a lot of counseling, I can handle that.  What I can't handle is thinking that the youngest my be the product of a sick fuck who had kids to rape them.  

Is the youngest of our siblings also your child?  

*...taking a break...*

I thought about this in 2009 and haven't been able to bring myself to address it.  This is probably the one thing that is so hard for me to think about without getting furious to mom combined with a terrible nausea and fits on crying.  If it is true, or if it isn't I just wanted to tell you sorry that I couldn't protect you from the other abuse.

If you are my brother and if you are not, I just wanted to write this to say that it wasn't right.  None of it was right.

Which is basically almost impossible at the moment, usually.

And by that, I mean, finding YOUR dream and LIVING YOUR dream/desires.

What I recommend is expressing what you feel INSTEAD of reaching out to her. I'm NOT recommending you play games - I'm NOT about that at ALL, I'm saying PUT your feelings into a FORM, like writing, singing, etc.

And I think that it would help you a GREAT deal to DO this with your feelings about anxiety etc.

It helps to write/draw/color etc in public, SO much, and to KEEP making art of all kinds, even if you think you're crap at it.

Just KEEP expressing your feelings, and you CAN get somewhere with that, and over time it becomes easier to trust yourself with spontaneity. It's NOT easy. Things like meditation so you can quiet your mind and realize how your thoughts/feelings can work together are key as well.

You need to find YOUR passions and what YOU care for, what kind of future YOU want to have, HOW you'll make money, and WHAT you'll do with that money.

Get into the world! Look into the future! Not to LIVE there, but to FIND a grounded future is a REALLY big deal, and SUPER important, because the girl you are with is going to be thinking about THAT future, where she wants to be, and that's a big part of romance, from my experience, honestly.",,0.0,,2014-01-21 05:39:50,,,0,False,,,,0,,ceuv5eh,,,,,t3_1vq26j,,,t1_ceuv5eh,,,,t3_1vq26j,,,,,,,,1432034743.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

Why did you choose Netherlands if you can't even speak the language ? Nevertheless surely you can find a job that doesn't require knowledge of the language, you just have to keep looking. Also, while it's natural to be upset that your parents don't care about you the way you think they should, the problem appears to be more about the fact that your father refuses to give you anymore money and you have to find a job rather than focusing on your studies without worrying about money. My advice for you would be to focus on becoming independent and taking care of yourself, take your life in your own hands. Find a job, finish your studies and pursue whatever goal your want. Try to isolate your parents from your life, the more you think about being left alone the more depressed your will get, so try to just accept the fact that your parents are not there for you, and try to rely on yourself and your friends.

127529,,True,JomaxZ,,,,"I wonder if you are able to hear / understand what Lolzor said in his/her comment?  That is, how is it hearing those words?

I don't disagree with that notion either.  I see that the fact that you are concerned that resources to sustain you could sustain others seems to imply on some level that you care about others.  And I also agree with Lolzor that in the Western world where there is a material glut, there is a dearth of caring individuals (or at least ones who are able to express their care outwardly, to others).

But, I didn't come here just to agree with the poster above me!  :-P  Or did I?  Hmm.

Probably not.  

So, when you get that question ""when are you ...?"" is that internally (like it pops up in your brain spontaneously just to bother you every now and then?) or externally (somebody else asking you)?  I suppose it could be both ... questions that get to us externally are often internalized until they are resolved, metabolized, sloughed off, or answered.

You say that you want nothing more than having your basic human needs met ... I'm curious what this looks like to you?  As in, what standard of ""basic human needs.""  I mean, I know folks living without electricity and cars and who grow their own food to be super low foot-print and to model a different lifestyle.  I know a lady who practices stone-age level technology and spends a month a year living out with only stone-age tech.  I know lots of folks who live in community and share responsibilities for cleaning, cooking, gardening, childcare to support each other.  (And so on...)

But basic human needs are not so basic, and how one goes about meeting them are myriad.  If you meet them in a way that excites you, it might excite others as well.  So yeah, what do you consider your ""basic human needs""?  Of course, there's a theory that basic human needs can be really deep and expansive and connect to everything (that is, a desire for warmth, is a desire to live, is a desire to thrive, is a desire for warmth for other beings, is a desire for others to live, is a desire for others to thrive, etc.) -- but anyway, I digress...

I was recently talking with a man for about fifteen minutes when he came up with a theory about me.  I had mentioned that I was wrestling (I'm a male, at the age of 27 at the time) with what to do with my life and wanting to ""do more"" with my life and I was talking a bit about losing my faith.  And what he told me his theory was, went something like this:

""Now don't take this the wrong way, but I think you have a dominant feminine energy.  Every person has both masculine and feminine energy"" [much like yin/yang, yin I think, feminine, yang, masculine -- outward focused energy / inward focused, something :-P] ... ""and this society's dominant culture is dominated by this story that all the gods are masculine and that every body (women included) should be masculine (in energy).  We should be doers and manifesters and active and successful"" [and cut-throat and desire big accomplishments, etc.] ... ""but not everyone does and to try to force yourself to do so is foolish.""

I'm sure I'm embellishing what he said a bit.  But as soon as he was saying it, it was resonating.  I've tried studying the hard sciences and fantasizing about making earth-shattering discoveries, and I've fantasized about learning amazing trade-skills and building works of stunning technical brilliance, and I've fantasized about being a great leader of men.  But what I have generally most enjoyed was being present with people -- teaching, caring, talking, listening, laughing, celebrating, mourning.  Things my friend might call ""feminine energy"" activities.  But both men and women have a mixture of both energies.  I'm not sure why I'm sharing that with you, but I thought I might in case its relevant.

I have one more three-part question if you'd be so kind:

a) Once you meet your basic human needs (as you define them), what do you do with your time?  Would you enjoy having more free time?

b) What have you enjoyed doing in your life?  What have you not enjoyed doing (especially interesting if these are things you are ""supposed"" to like)?

c) Do you have any hobbies?

Not my best friend, no one. It's hard to say things out loud, the things that make you wake up screaming in the middle of the night, the things that leave you empty.
 Maybe it'd be easier typing it? I need someone to hear me, to listen; and not scold me and tell me how selfish, or stupid I am for cutting and purging when I eat. For someone to just listen, or in your case, read.
 When I was a little girl I idolized my mother. She's the ""perfect woman"" skinny, pretty, blonde. I was always a chubby kid and she'd call me disgusting, a pig, and make me cry for days when jeans didn't fit or if I went up a size and it started when I was ten. Now I hear her voice every time I eat or look in a mirror. I think ""you're such a pig. How can anyone even stand to look at you?"".  My mom slaps me across the face sometimes, and is always screaming. 
 She hates that I'm not Christian, and told me I'm going to hell and I'm not allowed to poison my brother and sister's mind against her. 
 My dad is the same way. Only he calls me a slut and a whore because he found out about an ex boyfriend sexually abused me. He thought that I wanted it and instead of therapy, he just looks at me with shame. He never calls anymore, and whenever i see him all he does is yell on and on about how i'm a huge disappointment.
 My step dad (before him and my mom divorced.) used to throw me against the wall and shake me/pull my hair.
 Recently I've had friends leave me because they feel like I'm not ""real"" with them, because it's so hard to tell them why I'm like the way I am. I've tried telling them that it's hard for me to open up.
  My parents are in such an outrage because they found out I was bisexual too, and called me a freak. ""You're either gay or straight, and faggots go to hell."". My mom doesn't want to be known as the ""mother of a bisexual satanist slut."".
 I'm so tired, reddit. No one cares anymore. I'm a freak. The people who gave me life think I'm a disgrace, my old friends think I'm selfish and won't talk to me, and I sound like a whiny teenager. I just needed to tell someone. I've already written my goodbye letter. So, here's a final goodbye to you. I've always loved you reddit, you were there through every bad time with your funny cat pictures, memes, quotes, and puns. Right now you're my only friend.
 Goodbye.

However, once my mother got pregnant with me, my dad advocated for an abortion. My mom refused, and my dad began to produce an affair. Years later, my dad divorces my mother, and makes her in a terrible financial situation.

I go to parties with friends about 2 times a week, i drink and dance, but its all fake, I dont really want to be there. When complementing people I am really just lieing to their face. 

I have litteraly no hobbies anymore (when i was younger i used to draw alot (won awards), played football, basketball and swam for a team. I workout every day, i run 40 km a week and do all sorts of exercise. I dont enjoy any of this, its just something i force myself to do to not let my mind wander.

So recently, thoughts of suicide have been popping up in my head, more and more often. Whenever Im alone, i drive my self insane with destructive thoughts. It scares me that I am even here posting this, I dont know why these thoughts are comming into my head. Am i just deprressed or could I really in the dangerzone?

That's more or less the conceptual core of it. You find something that if the hypothesis is true, you'd expect to see one thing, and if it was false, then something else.

My story starts 2 years ago I was in the academic extension for year7 (the first of high school) I was nearly a straight a student, I had great friends that I saw out of school even though I lived a distance away.  

Now comes the time i fucked up.
About half way through term one I just stopped going, that year I got only 45% attendance. My grades dropped, I didn't talk to friends, I then my great grandmother died.
Skip to April 2013 I'm in mainstream getting shit grades and on shit terms with my friends and then my great grandfather dies. I make a few new friends but virtually no contact out of school, a all I do is watch tv and play games. September 2013 my grandfather (the closest person to me) gets cancer dec 2013 he dies 
Today I am in year 9 my grades are still shit, partially because of my mother refusing to let me put the PC back or do it herself so I lose 40% on my English and s and e.ive grown to hate her. I try to talk to my old friends especially one girl named Emily who I've known for a very long time who at one point in 2013 I asked out then found out she was going out with someone else.

Part of the beauty of Reddit is that it is a **transient meritocracy where people are primary judged by their contributions**, and therefore through their comments, and people's reactions to them, you have a pretty good idea what they are about in an online context. You can ban him, but anyone who wants to can come back in two seconds, so I think its a rather fruitless process. But I can see the frustration.

If he wants to talk, then talk, or better yet, **he should stop hijacking other people's posts like he's a whacked BILLY MAYS selling quick, cheap and painless exits and discuss what really is on his mind** and maybe it will help him. Or not. But it would be more productive than this shit. But I say let it stand because its obvious he has an axe to grind and he's going to keep banging on the door anyway. 

Then maybe someone will see what he really is, **a person who has endured a lot of pain**, who has not succeeded in changing that themselves and **therefore decides that so many other people must be like him.**  Its like misery loves company, but in this case its like misery loves more misery!

[Just check out his comment history,](http://www.reddit.com/user/threw_it_away) it speaks for itself.

Now I've been reading this little corner of Reddit off and on since the beginning, primarily because I was bored at work, and I remember one of the first incidents that created it. I'm mostly a reader, I don't really care to comment, just bopping between this and Google news or whatever amuses me. But **I was touched by a group of people, a lot of long time redditors, who came together to help someone out, someone who maybe was just crying out or whatever the reason.** 

Now looking at this joker, I imagine for someone like that, who maybe has tried everything they can and perhaps having no one to help and not have anything work, its hard to watch some of these people, getting attention. Hell, if someone posts this stuff anywhere else on Reddit and half the assholes come out to mock or complain like its 2-for-1 mixers at the local pub. Its like the opposite of here. So you have to feel sorry for the guy. I honestly do.

Right up until he does **THIS**. Then thats where my sympathy runs out when they decide that **their pain has to be everyone's pain.** Its not, asshole! (that guy, not you Nico3d3, sorry). If they want to talk about something here then they should **nut up, post their own fucking post and talk about themselves** and since its a throw away account already, they don' t even have to change their name. But instead come out and speak just for themself. 

Anyone with Google can find whatever they are looking for, so they're not actually helping anyone. There is actually an authoritative science book on it so its not a fucking mystery. But that's not why people come to this subreddit so his comments are disingenuous. If they actually talked about their pain, then perhaps it would actually help someone. But **just when they start to comment in a way that makes you think you want to give them the benefit of the doubt...**  Whoops! Still no.

While I have been suicidal at other times in my life, it became a very serious problem for me 2 years ago when I was busted for viewing child pornography.  Yes, really :/  Some people cut themselves or fuck strangers because of their mental illness, I consume violent media (watch horror movies and look at pictures of dead people), and when anxious enough go so far as to look at illegal pornography.  I am in no way justifying my behavior, but my crime was non violent and didn't involve an immediate victim.  I am a pacifist at heart and would never, never lay a hand on anyone, and  more importantly have never had the desire to hurt anyone, much less a child.

Since then I was sentenced to 6 months of house arrest (was facing 4 years in Federal prison) and put on the sex offender registry which is a life time commitment.  After 1 week on house arrest I attempted suicide, failed, and was immediately arrested and put in jail for violating the terms of house arrest.  After a month I was let out and put back on house arrest.  I have 2 months left.

It was my 5th attempt since the cops showed up at my door 2 years ago, the final straw for my wife.  While she earnestly believes I would never hurt our son, I am no longer to be around him unsupervised since she doesn't trust that I won't try to hurt myself again.  Surely can't blame her.  We no longer live together and she is soon moving to a different city.

In a matter of a couple of years I lost my job, my wife, my son ... my whole life.  When you Google my name my sex offender information comes up.  It's completely surreal, especially since I've spent much of my life advocating for victim's of sexual and domestic violence.  Again, I'm not justifying my actions but by looking at those pictures I was trying to hurt myself, not anyone else.

I have been in and out of therapy for years, and on and off medications for years.  At the end of the day I'm not sure there is anything that can really convince me there is any inherent meaning to this thing we call life, so why shouldn't I just skip to the last chapter and end it?

Everyday is painful.  I want so much to be able to teach my son that he can overcome any obstacle in his life (including mental illness), but I just can't bare the thought of being away from him and knowing for the rest of my life I will be branded as a sexual deviant.  It is my responsibility to him that is keeping me alive, I'm just afraid that won't last forever.

I was just hoping someone out there would understand.

Am I a terrible person?

Fortunately, I can talk to him of my fears but I'm afraid he'll grow tired of my whining eventually. I just feel lost and that there is no hope. I know there are many people who are worse off but still I feel that I don't want to live and that I am a failure.

How have you overcome suicidal thoughts and depression? How do you fight against the anxiety? I have been depressed before but not like I am now. I really do not see any hope.

How old is he? Does he have any outlets to vent through? If he likes art he could paint as an attempt to release all those harsh emotions being thrown on him. I'm always a fan of writing out what you're feeling on paper so you can get a better handle on the situation so if he hasn't tried anything like that I would advise it, oftentimes it can be just like having a therapist except no one is there to guide ones train of thought. There are various other outlets as well and I'm sure that there is a positive one that will work for him.

If you think for a moment that he will go through with suicide don't hesitate and make sure he gets help. As someone who has lost people to suicide before, take it seriously and don't shoulder all the burden or attempt to help him all by yourself. Good luck and I hope his family starts understanding soon.

67839,,True,sillynose12345,,,,"Clinical standpoint: Self harm is a type of addiction, though not commonly seen as one. It's a pain addiction, due to the positive feeling that comes from it. As much as it might hurt the first couple of times, after a while that pain seems to go away, and the benefit seems to increase. This is because your brain tolerates to the pain quicker than it does to the benefit. But, as with most addictions, it is very likely that the positive feeling from self harm will decrease with time, as your body tolerates to the neurotransmitters created by the action. Eventually, you would need more stimulation (cutting) to get the same reaction. This eventual increase in behaviour may lead to more dangerous forms of self harm that may get the individual killed.

You also may associate not just the pain, but the view of the blood coming out. Same problem, more blood may become required to get the same reaction.

Neither of these are for sure though, many people engage in self harm behaviours that do not get worse over time. But it is not the majority. Thats one reason why it is viewed as bad.

Publicly: The idea of hurting yourself for relief is not an easy thing to swallow for most individuals. It's very counterintuitive. Why would a person want to hurt themselves blah blah blah that sort of thing. Many people don't understand the appeal, kind of similar to people's reactions to BDSM and that sort of thing.

I am also do not think i would kill myself, but I do fear that i am becoming to reckless. Basically, I feel emotionally Drained at the moment, and I stumbled across this sub-reddit awhile ago and thought maybe someone would like to talk, or just listen.

I am current 18 years old and a male, I grew up in the worse part of Canada. Suicide, death and disappointment was always a big role in my life. I was also unfortune enough to be born with a rare case of speech aperixa and Autism. My family life was great, but the neighourbour hood was ridiculously horrid. I was bullied all my life and still am bullied. This leading me to have horrible self confidence. My first experience with death was very little, most of my uncles died due to lung cancer from smoking to much, or suicide. I also did not have any money Growing up, my mother and father worked 2 jobs each and left me and my siblings home alone a lot. thankfully me and my brother stayed close but my sister got into drugs and gangs and what not. she suffers from bi polar and takes it out on me and my older brother (shes the oldest.) Blah i dont know where im going with this but all im trying to get across is that i had a rough time growing up. Death, bulling and Poverty.

Ive suffered from depression pretty much my whole life. I met a girl when i was in 14 that saved me from this. i love her a lot and She means the world to me. when i was 17 I stood by my grandmothers side as her kidneys failed and She was there by my side the whole time. I didnt cry when my grandmother passed, im a logical thinker so i knew it was coming, i accepted it and moved on with the support her. I also took my basic parachutist course (im a paratrooper) at only 17! which is my proudest Life accomplishment, but i couldn't do it with out her. She lifted my spirit, and thats a big reason why i am here.

Anyways, i feel like im at the end of my rope lately because this last month was fucking horrific. everything that could go wrong is going wrong. It all started with one of my closest friend killing herself, it sucked i knew her since i was like 12. that was a rough fault, but she supported me. that same week my best friend killed himself. i knew him since i was 5. once again i stayed strong and showed no weakness. i had great support with family and her.

After i grieved for awhile, i continued life. until my uncle killed my auntie then himself. this was rough i was really close with them and it shocked me that he could do that. but like i said im a logical and mythological thinker so i dealt with it the best way i could and she was always there to lean on. a week after that incident my Great uncle, whom i visited monthly died of old age. Sadly i could not be there on his death bed due to university and he lived 3 hours away. i attended his funeral and once again she was there to lean on. just like she always was and always will be... so i thought.

a few weeks ago she dumped me. Saying she needed to Find herself. i have never felt more lost, more confused more disappointed in my entire life. Like i said i like to believe im a logical thinker, but this, i cant Seem to find a point where my mind is the winner. my heart is in pieces and every time i try to come to an honest conclusion my body aches and i just weep. I just dont know what to do. I love her and always will, and although everyone says that ill find someone else i feel like i wont. And as stupid as that sounds, i know it sounds stupid i hear myself and i think to myself that im an dumb ass for thinking that, its the only conclusion i can see at the moment. my heart is so dedicated and so loyal that the thought of anyone else is redonkulous.

I feel discarded, i feel old and boring. Like a simple phase made my life lose meaning. i was there for her, and she was there for me and now all of a sudden im alone again. My friend are all drug addicted or bad influences and i dont want to go down that road. i am the only friend i have with a grade 12 and the only one who is in university. i have horrible social skills and i feel like i cant find anyone who can know me aswell as she did. i told her everything and she told me everything i feel like i lost a part of me.

i feel like i need help but i dont know where to go. Ive cried to my mother enough and i dont want to be a burden, ive tried to talk to my friends but they just dont get it? we were talking me and her, but all of a sudden we just stopped, the biggest part my life is suddenly a stranger yenno? its a weird and emotional time for me with everyone dying and i have no one to fall back on. I have nobody, so i came to you guys. i hope someone has had a similar experience or something close, and i realize that not all situations are the same but i just need to vent i guess.

Regardless, im starting to drink a lot. starting to stay out late (used to be home at like 11, because Fuck to police) ahah no, i used to be home early out of respect for my mother and father. i like to think im a respectful young adult, but my lifes going to shit. im barely going to university and im scared im going to fail. Actually... im just scared. the unknown is now the only thing i have left. i used to hit the gym regually but not even that seems boring and everything i do is just a memory of her. it just nothing makes sense and i need a helping hand but i dont know where to start.

honestly the only thing i have currently is my music, and my fave artist is Taylor swift which doesnt help because all she fucking sings about is her exs. what the fuck is wrong with me reddit? Urggh. i dont know im just ranting now i apologize. Regardless can you guys help me out?

P.s i realize how ridiculous this is, i tottaly jumped all over the place, i just have a lot on my mind currently and i havent talked to anyone about all this. please forgive me and i thank you sincerely if you read my whole post. it means a lot just to know that someone listened, while... Read, what i was feeling. thank you. also i dont know you, but just know that i love all of you guys. a lot. thank you, ill try to stay up to read any replies i may get, but because its kinda late i doubt anyone will see this.

41552,,True,SpeareShake,,,,"I'm really grateful for this post. The danger with giving an ""I'm here to help!"" post is that you never know what someone will PM you with. It could be a situation where you have absolutely no idea what to say, and in that case you can't just ignore the person who PM'd you. It's tricky. 

Additionally, if you have something truly helpful to say,  you should post in for all to see, that way we can all hear your insight. Like SQLwitch said, it could potentially help multiple suicidal people who just don't have the courage to post anything. It's like in class if you ask a question, chances are a few other people had the same question as you, so you may as well get the helpful information out there.

And it doesn't matter what others say, you know your imperfections; you know you're treated differently because of how you look; you know that beautiful people are wanted by others and ultimately, you are invisible. Clothes don't fit you right. Makeup collects in your fine creases and clumps on your oily and porous skin. You try to hang out at cool places and people either ignore you, or worse, try to be nice as they scurry away. No one wants to be your friend. Even your friends don't want to be your friend, you think. And your lover would obviously be f*cking a younger, fitter person that you could never be.

It all sounds really depressing, because it is. And no matter how much they tell you they love you and think you're great, no matter how much people say they appreciate you, you can't get over that ugly feeling. My life was MISERABLE when I was younger and I've come such a long way, I never thought I'd make it this far. But the suicidal thoughts simply never go away. I don't know what to do. I can push them out of my head for a few months, but always, they return, since I was just 10 years old (I found a really scary journal entry from then the other day). 

**Is there anyone out there who can relate to this? Anyone who understands? Anyone who has been through this and has ideas that can help?** Honestly, I just am not interested in advice from happy people anymore. It's so great that you're happy and that you've always been that way, but you have no idea what it's like to feel so low and your simple cures do not work on me. Thank you anyway though, I appreciate your compassion though, of course:)

16274,,True,throwaway20100817,,,,"But even once I dealt with the Zoloft issue, I was still depressed. I was disorganized. IB requires a crazy amount of dedication and work, and I had so much going on... I got a few Cs, and a D in European History. I scored high enough on the PSAT to qualify as a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist. 90% of semifinalists become finalists, opening the doors for ALL KINDS of full-ride scholarship opportunities, which I desperately needed. Because of my grades, I was one of the 10% who didn't. 

If I hadn't done IB, I would have had straight As in regular-ed classes, and I would have qualified, no-problem. Kids who did less work than me got it. Why couldn't I have it? 

Senior year was a mess. For IB we had to write extended essays -- basically like a mini-thesis of between 2200 and 3500 words. I did mine on how music influenced the spread of Christianity in the Byzantine era. I got a B. But that's getting ahead of myself. One of my friends was writing on an extremely similar topic... I don't remember what, but something to do with both music and history, like mine. The category guidelines were confusing, and we both entered our essays under the ""music"" category... later my friend talked to the IB coordinator and found out they really should have gone under ""history"". She got hers corrected with the coordinator, no problem... she told me I should go talk to the coordinator as well. So I did. I told her pretty much, ""I have the same problem as [friend], this is my topic, can I change the category?""

And she fucking flipped shit, gave me a humongous lecture. ""You were a National merit Semifinalist, I know you're smarter than that!"" Because I was confused about which category my essay should go in, because my advisor told me the wrong thing, and my friend made the exact same mistake. 

She didn't get yelled at. Why did I? 

Eventually, I graduated. I got the IB diploma, but without being a national merit finalist I didn't get any full rides. I ended up going to a no-name state school. Doing IB got me 26 credits to start with, which was pretty sweet... during high school I had started an online relationship, through the online friend of an IRL friend. And in the first year of college, it was great -- I had all this independence, I lived in the dorms away from my fucking family, my classes were easy again, IB had given me some good study skills (and terrible anxiety, but whatever), and I got to spend hours just talking to my boyfriend on the phone. 

Then he joined a WoW raiding guild, and I hardly got to talk to him. Then he got second thoughts about our relationship and broke up with me to date a local girl. I was devastated, and spent the entire summer in my bedroom barely leaving my bed. Things didn't work out, and I took him back. 

He lived in New York, and I lived in the Midwest. He made it pretty clear that he wasn't coming to me. I visited him a few times, and I liked New York, from a touristy perspective. I rushed through undergrad, finishing in 3 years thanks to my IB credits. I got a Political Science degree which was pretty useless, because I don't know shit about politics anymore. I was probably the least knowledgeable of politics in my major... I really cared about social issues and human rights, but I didn't care about the history or the economic side of things... exaggerating, but still. Looking back I should've just majored in Women's Studies or Sociology. But I didn't, so here I am being embarrassed and defensive whenever anyone tries to talk politics with me. 

Anyway, I rushed through my degree. Got a well-paying job doing data entry with the postal service -- my position existed all over the US, so they had to pay the same rate to everyone, but living in the Midwest (back with my shitty family, ugh) my expenses were extremely low. So I set about saving up to move to New York. 

Here's where I entered the worst depression of my life... that I still haven't come out of. I loved my Midwestern town, and didn't want to leave it. I was gainfully employed, whereas my boyfriend wasn't. He was depressed too, and he reached the point of ultimatums because he needed me to be there for him to be happy again. He got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I got really bitter, because... we were both incredibly depressed. But his parents were VERY well-off (mom makes six figures), and they coddled him and didn't make him do anything... he got to just lay around and play video games all day. I was just as depressed, but I was having to work my ass off doing data entry all day, getting a nasty case of carpal tunnel, for the POSTAL SERVICE, living with my SHITTY FAMILY when I made enough to get my own apartment in my town and be happy forever... I had political connections from my internship, I had prospects, he had nothing. But I had to come to him, or we would break up. 

The fucked up thing is, we talked about it later, and he thought he was ""saving"" me. He didn't think my friends were that good (???) and he knew my family was terrible... he didn't realize he was PROLONGING my stay with my family. Never mind that HE wasn't ""saving"" anything by playing WoW and handing out ultimatums. *I* was the one to do all of the work. 

I worked at the post office for nine months before picking up and moving to New York, to live in his parents' basement with him. He swore to me that, as soon as I moved, he would start looking for a job. His depression pretty much prevented that, in reality. I would look for jobs on Craigslist all day, while he sat and played WoW. His dad would try and pressure me into taking jobs that I wasn't qualified for at all, but that he had connections with that could probably get me in... stuff like fucking machine maintenance, when again, I have carpal tunnel and don't know shit about that. 

My boyfriend and I fought a lot. I started to really resent him. I can see now that he really was depressed and trying to run away from his problems, but... I resented him *so much* for having everything handed to him. For being allowed to lay around and play video games and not do work or school. I could never do that. The one summer where I worked part-time one day a week (when he broke up with me) was enough for my mom to get on my case, even though I was financially better off than she was thanks to student loans, and in fact loaning her money. 

Thanks to a combination of resentment and trauma from my previous living situation/rape, I stopped being able to have sex with him. Even though things are better now, I still can't manage intimacy more than once a month at best without feeling anxious and unsafe and scared. I know it wears on him. 

After five months, I managed to find something -- my current position, doing general office work for a nonprofit. This job is amazing. My co-workers are really nice, there's very little office politicking. My position is something I'm actually happy doing. After a couple of months of saving, we were able to move out into our own apartment, in a neighborhood I decided on and that I love dearly. My boyfriend got a job, too, and he came out of his depression, and... everything is honest-to-god wonderful now. 

But I spend every day in a depressed, anxious, *paranoid* haze. Wondering if I'm going to say something stupid on the phone and someone's going to get mad at me at work. Wondering if I'm going to say the wrong thing to a co-worker. Wondering if I'm getting enough work done, if my supervisor is going to be happy or disappointed (this isn't the kind of place where they would put much emphasis on that -- she knows I'm working hard, but I still worry). Wondering if this will be the day my boyfriend leaves because I won't have sex with him. Hating myself for moving his hand when it starts to move up my leg, but feeling so scared and sick if I let things progress. Sometimes on the train I feel like everyone is glaring on me. I feel like everyone is out to get me, even though it doesn't make any sense. 

I mean it when I say my boyfriend has done a complete turn-around. He plays games very casually, takes care of the majority of the housework since he works part-time... after some bumps, he is very understanding of my sexual issues... and he holds me and lets me cry when I'm sad. But I know it's wearing on him. And I don't know how much more he can take.

41531,,False,NearlyMe,,,,"I just feel like for what I'm making (about $2 above minimum wage here) that my boss is asking a ton from me. We get due dates for tasks and he's having me in charge of all the technology in the building (so when it goes wrong I have to figure out how to fix it), making the employee schedule, ordering for all the food/supplies and I have to train new managers in the projection booth. On top of having to complete these due dates (usually stupid menial tasks) and also replying to every e-mail every single day I work (I get about 20-30 per day). And on top of that he usually sticks me in the concession stand, where I can't leave the floor unless another manager is present. And we have to be under 40 hours every week or else we get marked on our report cards (yes, we have a report card for every month...). And your raise depends on what score you get on your report cards... 

As far as the guy goes, I just feel like it's a constant roller coaster... he says he wants me around but I've been seeing him for almost a year and he still doesn't actually want to date me. When I bring it up he says he doesn't think that he's ready and he says that I'm too emotional and if I weren't so emotional it would 'be more attractive'. I just feel like he's giving me the song and dance - trying to put me down and make it MY problem. Like it's MY fault that I feel so strongly for him. And whenever I say I just want to not see him then he gets all butthurt and says 'I want you to be in my life'. But yet everytime we just hang out as friends he's trying to hook up or ask me for favors. He has a friend who is very similar that I hang out with too - they both just seem to be ok with mooching off of other people. 

WOO. That felt so good to get off my back. If you read all that, thanks, I appreciate the chance to vent. :x

I heard you guys like to help. I thought I'd come here to read other people's stories and how they managed to feel better. I can't. Text is like a wall. All I can do is look at it. I don't know why I'm writting this, I don't know who you guys are. I'm normally a /b/tard, but for good reason, /b/ doesn't deal with this kind of shit. I probably won't read replies, but I'll try to, maybe tomorrow. Let me just post the highlights of my life, someone needs to know.

It started out when I was 11 or 12. One day, I was playing megaman with my best friend in his basement and his mom's boyfriend showed up and asked if we wanted to take a ride with him and the rest of his family. We thought nah, we'd just stay there and play games. So they left, and they never came back. The guy probably needed help, he locked my friend's mom and his two children (he had two daughters) in the car and set it on fire in the woods, then hung himself. That was the last day I ever saw my friend, he went to live with his dad and I have no idea what happened to him. To anyone who asks I say he suicided.

What the fuck is this life we're living. How can you expect people to put so much effort in something that can just be destroyed into shit by anyone who decides to do so. What if I had been in that car, what if it was my dad who went ape shit, what if I could've stopped him, why the fuck am I alive. Why the fuck am I here.

And so I grow up with these questions bumping up and down in my head endlessly. Needless to say I developped an ""interface"" personnality to keep on living, which is a perfect copy of what I used to be before the incident that interacts with people around me, end-users of my personnality who use me for my good, raw, sense of humour for a smile and my rather impeccable sense of logic for easy math help. I realized I was pretty good looking and started meeting girls. I thought that would make me happy again. If you've ever asked yourself what it is to be a true asshole, ask yourself no more. Just keep reading. I have lied to, manipulated and fucked more girls than any other teen I know. I'd try them like patches and, seeing how it wasn't fixing anything, would go and try another patch. And another. And another. Until I realized the problem was not the quality of the patch but the size of the hole. I've barely even talked with a girl ever since.

I was pretty good at school, and all I had to do for A's was sit down in class, listen, and puke all the information out during exams. It worked well enough to get me into my country's top University (I'm canadian, go figure out where I go) in one of their harder programs, computer science. Of course that kind of stuff doesn't work anymore, anyone who has been to university knows the amount of work you have to put in no matter how smart you think you are. And so I'm stuck.

I carried that shell of a body for 8 years now, I'm almost 20, and I'm stuck. I'm sorry everyone but that's as far as I can go. I drink myself to sleep almost every night. I try to get interested in the subject that I study, but holy fuck. How can I work hard and make sacrifices for the 3 years I need to finish my B.S. if I can barely live with myself when I don't.

I will not be contempt with a minimum wage job living alone at my parents.

I want to be anonymous as i tell you my story and asking for advice.

My life has been quite shitty, i was bullied in school and took alot of shit from first years i got into school untill 7th grade. 

In the summerbreak between grade 4 and 5 i switched school, and it got all way worse. I started to loose myself, i got suicidal, and at that time i did play league, but the first years of playing league it was just a tempoary game, i didint watch LCS, i didint do it to improve, just to get away a bit, because i hated life.

In grade 7 i felt suicidal and had tunnel vision about anything i did. 

In the summerbreak of grade 7 to 8, i collapsed and that's when my family decided i should switch school again. 

This time , when i started grade 8, it was actually good, but i never had any real friends earlier in life, and here it was really like a dream.

In grade 8 i continued to play league, still didint watch LCS or so, but i started to get a bit better but i started to see more things and from other point of veiws.

After half the school year , when it was christmas, the family troubles between us became bigger, and from early december into 3 mounths later it was a huge preassure in our home. I had visited a friend once, not more because i felt i wasent ready for it yet.

After christmas, in january when i should start school again, i refused.  I felt so shit, was about to take my life but my bigbrother stopped me from doing so, i'm not sure if he knew how bad i felt, but he tried make it reasonable at home. It went a bit better and after some weeks i went to school again for real.

During all this i had a depp depression which only gotten worse and worse in  my whole life expect some mounths after i started 8th grade where it actually got a bit brighter for a while, but then turned back.

During the summerbreak of grade 8 and 9, i invited two guys to watch some movies together and it was great even if i almost never talked much to them, they were trying to talk to each other to make it easier for me to join them, and this was at the end of the summerbreak.



Grade 9 started, and i were present maybe 70% of the time, it variated, the things of the social things i missed was huge, and i enjoyed watched them having fun, but it was so hard for me, because it was so hard at home, and so much that we couldin't have our own opinions or do as we like, because mom and dad were arguing alot with each other and with us. It turned out later that dad had huge alcohol problems, i'll get back to that later.

The first part of the schoolyear went ~okay. The second one? sigh...


In january, i had a huge depression. I felt suicidal at the start of the mounth, and as each day passed, it was more often i got these thoughts, and, it got more real.

At early februry, i started to make suicide plans, on how i should kill myself. But i went to a friend, with the thinking of: If i'm going to die, it dosen't matter how this turns out.

It did well thought and i spoke alot about him what's going on at home and how i feel and how my parents treat me, i felt that stopped me for suiciding then.

Oh, i almost forgot, league. I was never a too huge fan of flaming, but i allways took the negative feedback i got because that's what ive been taught doing at home, this is something that hurts me a bit now and i'll talk more with this later.


In March, one dude the family ""know"" came to our place, he was an alcoholic too long ago and had huge troubles with his family, he was in ""coma"" i believe it's called, he and his wife separated etc etc and so on.

He came to us in march was home at us for 3 weeks helping us.

When aroud half of that time had passed, we took a family meeting and alot of information between mom and dad came forth and alot of arguing and so and dad had been really addicted to alcohol and we children didint have a clue, because he were allways behaiving like this. He stated about that he dont want to live with us more, because it's so much easier living by himself without somone to take care of or to think of. 

He also had alcohol problems, and his body was about to get sick.

He is my dad, so it hurted me alot he dont want to stop drinking or anything, even after i told them all in family, that ive felt suicidal in january, very frequently and sometimes it was starting to get real. 

Now something happens that changed my life into something better.

The next day, was a moonday that day and i was almost at the classroom when i saw my friend comming, we were both late, and i asked him if we could skip school and go home to him( he lives only 5-6 minutes of walking away)


and i told him. everything. the problems, the things, the suicidal plans i had. everything. i told a teacher that you really can talk to, and he also helped out.

I only visited that friend once before and i never talked in school, but this time i told him everything, and i refused to go home because it's no point for me to live there.

I stayed with him for 4 days before i returned home.


The first days after life felt quite nice, because it was starting to go okay again.

This was mid-end of march.


I'll jump more forward now.


At early april i felt i should start playing League of Legends again because i were allways feeling bad and thought of myself as a really bad human being, also because i wasent high diamond ranking ~ at my old school, because they told me alot of nasty things and punched me for that, aswell as many other things they bullied me for.  So my self confidience never been good, and i felt i didint want to live serveral times because i could have fun at school and try to learn how to talk with other people and beeing with people and friends, but at home i was foreced to do things i did not want.

but anyway.


at early-mid april i started to go to a psychologist and she was really good. It was some weeks here that i felt bad because of my parents, why they were acting like they did and why i allways got dragged in, and i really didint have the courage to try ranked because i still, almost two years after, believed what they said at my old school, that i'm not a good human if i cant do that good or something.

but yeah, despite all this it was a bit more OK for some weeks and i started to go play LoL some. I went from s3 to p5 in three days only soloQing in the end of season 3 for rewards, but i never considered myself good, thought it all was luck. But i started to play my 10 games to get ranked, and i got gold 1, it was nice. in about two weeks i climbed to diamond 5 and i got a guide up to /r/summonerschool and i almost start believed i wasent that bad human beeing, that i can want to do things good to.

soon after i hit d3 and went to d2, while this was going on we went to crete on a classtrip(end of 9th grade) and it happened alot there, they were some class fights, alot of alcohol things and i really disliked alcohol and tried to kept me away from it because of my parents. and it did happen some really bad things with especially one person in class.

Anyway i felt i wanted to live after that thoguht because i realised that i had fun, and i dont need my parents permission to have fun or like, be with friends. i started to see my friend like 1-3 times a week and that felt nice.

Moving on to june, at the start of june i reached diamond 1 and i got confidience back there too, yet however, soon, my end of the two years i should spend my life on this school on, would come to an end.

I felt pointless and worthless, i felt everything was useless and it was no point in doing anything.  and the day come and the whole class(almost) were having fun after the end, we spent half an day together and we had so much fun.

This was june 11. 

On june 12, the day after. i felt like not doing anyway. i wont go back to something. i wont have something. i cant do anything nice.

i didint want to suicide because i felt that would make my classmates feel bad.

Sometimes before the ending of school, my dad (who stopped drinking after i got back home from staying at a friend's place), started to behaive like usual, was more made, a bit more uncontrollable, he and mom had heavy argues sometimes when we werent in the house, because we could tell from how they felt, and how they looked and acted like when we were home.

We also saw dad drinking one day, and i felt suicidal again.
I forgot to mention i had daily contact with one guy from /r/suicidewatch daily for aroud 1 ½- 2 weeks because i felt i couldint live without anyone to talk to.

I contacted my friend and we talked a bit here and there last days,and tomorrow im going to him.

I started playing ranked around the june 18th again, because i felt i'm going to try this because i really like this game and it's something that i may feel i want to play competetive in. I've felt like that so many times before, but since the classtrip to Crete it's been more and more because i like doing this.

I climbed the ranked to around 40-45~lp and yesterday evening and today when internet got fixed ive had around 70-80% win rate in soloQ and climbing towards challenger now, with a really nice and humble attitude, and nice kda's, heh.

But i dont know what i want to do. I'm going to my friend tomorrow.

I really dont want to suicide.  I don't want to play in LCS or get a team now i feel, cuz  i **know** i cannot live without my friend or any friends.

I like playing this game and i do enjoy doing this on my free time, i'm trying to stop carrying what others said and i enjoy Dyrus because he got a thick skin. I'm been performing extremely well and soon challenger.

I just don't know what to do.

am i HSP(High Sensetive Person)? (my mom tried to find a diagnosis why i may have depression and also got thinking of autism, but i wasent even close to that after some tests we made, and i feel a bit dissapointed of her wanting to have me like that.

I think she does see how it affects me, and it makes her feel pretty bad (""I'm a horrible person for doing this to you"" she says), but she feels compelled.  

She's always been quirky.  She grew up very detached from her parents (they were druggies and neglected her) and developed a little differently than most people as far as how she relates to people.  She had always thought she might be somewhat of a sociopath.  So while she knows it hurts me, and that upsets her, it's not in the same way that you or I would probably be upset.

I had actually thought about checking myself in to the hospital, just because when I'm sitting at home alone waiting for her to get home from work (about a three hour lapse in our schedules) I just feel like I'm going insane.  I can't enjoy anything and I'm not productive.  And then when she gets home I don't know what to say or do, afraid that I'll say the wrong thing and she'll leave, or I'll say nothing and miss the opportunity to fix it.  

The biggest thing stopping me from doing something like that is that it would make things very uncomfortable at work, and the cat would be out of the bag pretty quickly.  I feel ashamed admitting that I am essentially giving my wife permission to cheat on me because I know that she'll do it anyway, but if I consent she'll feel like I'm trying to help her.  

I don't know... it just seems so surreal.  Just weeks ago we were perfectly normal.  And honestly I don't know what a hospital will do to help.  

Plus this may sound kind of petty in the context, but if I am admitted there is a good chance I'll have my firearms taken away and lose the ability to purchase them again.",,0.0,,2012-01-17 17:47:53,,,0,False,,,,0,,c3i3x2k,,,,,t3_okwg9,,,t1_c3i3x2k,,,,t1_c3i3lc2,,,,,,,,1428195972.0,,2,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,2,,

It started January/February time last year.  I've been always felt a bit distanced with people because of my Asperger's Syndrome, so as a result I've never had a girlfriend or felt like I've really been able to open up properly to other people.  But after many oh-so-near opportunities with the opposite sex over the years, I finally met someone out of the blue in December 2012.  We got on really well straight off the bat, I was really strongly attracted to her, and I got the feeling that she felt exactly the same.  I went home to my family's for the Christmas holidays the day afterwards, but we kept in contact all the while and I thought that things might finally go well for once.  But once I came back and we met again with a group of mutual friends, I just closed up again; went back to my aspie habit of keeping quiet.  Things just weren't the same, and she hardly talked to me, so I just left and walked home feeling despondent, blaming myself for everything that had just happened.

That started off the self-loathing cycle, and things only got worse from there.  I would lie awake at night, thinking over every single mistake I'd ever made in my life, and I gradually lost all hope in my future.  It was only a couple of months time from then that I became a suicidal social shut-in.  Things got better for a while, but pressures over the summer from my family to get a job brought me back to that feeling of uselessness and hopelessness.  Nowadays, things technically aren't so bad for me, but I still feel like the damage has been done to my emotional balance.  (If that makes sense.)  I still go back to those suicidal thoughts.",,0.0,,2015-03-27 22:47:56,,,0,1427496669,,,,0,,cpt0xv5,,,,,t3_30ja69,,,t1_cpt0xv5,,,,t1_cpsy5ok,,,,,,,,1432053425.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

Believe it or not, this is how your brain literally learns - basically you're processing everything at once, and forgetting it as well. But when you try to recall something but can't (because you forgot it), that's actually the signal for your brain to remember it next time. It then draws connections to that idea. Keep forgetting, the more connections get added, and the louder that signal gets. Eventually you learn it. A lot of really smart kids get burnt out when they are older, because it's more important to be able to deal with a challenge, and getting good grades your entire life does not prep you for the inevitable failures in life. But the poor hungry and driven (phds) have dealt with challenges their entire lives, and can always keep their head in the game for the long run.

Take what your 'disadvantage' and make them push you forward. Jewish lawyers were a hated bunch. Everyone preferred to do business with wasps. but the most famous law firms today were founded by jews. You'd think that being a wasp, with endless connections and money, should be the key to being the best law firm in the world, but in fact that also hurt them. Basically, by being outsiders, Jews felt no shame in demanding money and being hostile, while waspy businessmen were all buddies and had more complicated relationships, and couldn't be so direct about money. So jews, they took a disadvantage, and made it into an advantage, making a name for themselves in hostile takeover situations. You need to take your losses and figure out how they give you an edge and push you forward, instead of holding you back.

Compete not against others but against yourself. This is business 101. Michael porter, the most famous businessman says competing against others is a sure way to just waste a lot of resources on one-upmanship. It's better to compete to be unique and provide a unique value instead of just beating the other guy. Thus, stop caring what others have accomplished and focus on what value YOU will deliver that's unique. When people engage in one-upmanship, they are by definition doing what everyone else is doing (but trying to be better). In truth, business prefer to be small monopolies where they don't have to compete. Think about google, they are a monopoly over internet advertising, but an ant in overall advertising (most ads are still TV focused). They aren't trying to take on madison ave, they are just being good at one UNIQUE thing. They pioneered a new form of advertising, and never needed to compete for it. They created a path for themselves, instead of competing over the old one. Instead of feeling useless comparing yourself to your peers, go out and and invent a creative way for you to be of value.

A few big wins make up for your many losses. If you look at the most succesful people out there, they make most of their wealth from very focused things. Steve jobs did it with apple despite getting fired from his own company, Warren Buffet made most of his money from a few stocks like Coke. Peter Thiel makes a ton of shitty investments to the point he had to close his funds, but he has Facebook to make up for them. The point is, you only need one big success. So if it takes 99 failures to get there, but the 100th try will be kick ass and make up for it, would you suck it up and deal with those 99 failures? You said you had no job, I guarantee if you call 100 people, one of them will give you a shot at a job. Question is, can you deal with 99 rejections?

It's not easy being a creative person in a world that devalues creativity, especially being a poet in a world that mostly ignores poetry.  But we don't get to choose our creative vocation; it is what it is.  (I struggled with that one for years.  No, decades.)

The folks who are getting on with their mundane, philistine lives are not more capable than you, they're less burdened.    And don't kid yourself, creative gifts are always also a burden.  That's why civilized societies help artists.   However, that sort of thing may not be an option for you where you're living or at the stage of your artistic career that you're at right now.

It sounds like you're crushed by a profound sense of failure, which I suspect is largely undeserved, and overwhelmed by the number of things wrong with your life that you need to fix, when you're at your least able to fix or change anything.  But you also need to survive, and your current situation sounds pretty lethal, at least to your soul.   Sometimes it can help to prioritize, to pick one thing (maybe the job search, for example) and put all the energy you have into it.  

I can't really think of specific suggestions for you but it would help if you could answer a couple of questions:

 * Where are you at in your alcoholism recovery (or relapse, if applicable :-\ ) process?  What kind of supports are you using there?

 * Have you ever tried counselling or therapy or anything like that in the past?

I found all kinds of resources on how to manage inatentive adhd, and even figured out a way for me to study for longer than 15 minutes!  (This is actually a HUGE deal)  Talking to my therapist, I found a substantial source of self confidence, and stopped thinking of myself as a failure.  In the past 3 months, I've studied more than I have in my entire life, and have gone on dates with some of the most intelligent women i've ever met.  Life actually seemed to be coalescing into a legitimate success story.

But,  I still suck at managing money.  While attempting to pay off overdue debt, and even going so far as moving into a smaller place to save money, i have nothing to show for it and i'm even worse off now that i started.  (i cant think clearly right now, I know that's a run on sentence)  I fell behind paying rent, because somehow I managed to either fill out my state tax form incorrectly, or HR didnt get/file it, and I ended up not having state taxes deducted from my paycheck for 2 years. I ended up getting a lien on my paycheck that removes just enough of my paycheck to throw what little control I had over finances out of equilibrium.  In catching up to some bills, and falling behind others, I ended up either paying rent late, or not at all for 5-6 months.

I'm 34 years old.  It's not like moving in with your parents is the end of the world, but in my case, it is.  My parents are 2 of the most fucked up people I know.  At no point have they ever truly treated me like an adult.  I moved out of the house at 18, because I absolutely hated being there.  They simultaneously new that I had higher than average intelligence, treated me like someone who couldnt see thought bullshit, and never considered that I wanted to GO AWAY TO COLLEGE AND GET AN EDUCATION.  Maybe it's their mentality that with enough faith in their god, things will just ""work out"" somehow.  But at no point did they ever do anything to prepare me to leave home, and live on my own. They didnt do anything. At all.  

Now, I've heard and understand the whole ""no one's perfect, parenting is hard, etc."" BUT there is a difference in trying, and missing some things, and outright leaving out that part of child rearing.  As far as I can see, they expected me to simply live at home, follow orders, and go to church twice a week.  All the years after I left, at any point when I called them for advice on something, the only response I get is ""why dont you come to the house"" or ""you should be here"", ""come home"".  By the way, my parents live about 80 miles away.  

I'm rambling a little, but i don't fucking care.

If a guy calls his dad for advice on how to handle a situation with his girlfriend, it's NOT NORMAL to suggest having her come over to their house to talk things over!  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THEM?  WHY WOULD A GROWN MAN BRING HIS GIRLFRIEND TO HIS PARENTS HOUSE, TO DISCUSS RELATIONSHIP ISSUES??

This is to help clarify the mentality that they have.  There is more, but suffice to say:  They are manipulative, super religious, and narrow minded.  It seems to be in their interest to maintain a co dependence, as opposed to having adult children who don't need them to help with everything.  Maybe that's not their intention.  But someone with some humility would at least see the direction things are going and do something about it.

Back to why I'm here.  I hardly have any tangible options.  funnier thing is, if I take the certification exam i've been studying for, i'd be qualified for jobs that pay 55k+, which would be more than enough to take care of all the financial bullshit. But i wont be ready to take it until at least the 3-4th week of the month, and by then i'll probably be living in my car.

Living where I do now is a pathetic existence.  Im hardly ever at home, and when I am there, I never leave the room.  besides the fact that I really can't stand being around people as socially awkward as my roommates are (they are inexplicably engaged). I've tried to bring them out with me to parties/bars/etc and it always ends with them getting belligerent with everyone, throwing shit, and starting fights. On top of that, I never have an idea of how i'd be able to pay back the rent that I owe.  The only tangible plan I had was to finish the certification exam, and get a better paying job.

It feels as if there really is nothing else to do, and to be honest, i'm just fed up with dealing with it.  If I were less talented, and didn't have any true potential, i think i'd feel a lot better.  Just knowing that money's ultimately keeping me from living a proper life is unbearable.

Don't worry, i'm not going to do anything stupid tonight. But I will say that in general suicide hotlines are worse than calling comcast customer service.  (i've called one a few years ago) It would go something like this:

-Hey

""how do you feel right now""

-like shit, thinking that being dead would be better

""where are you right now""

-my desk

""do you have any weapons, drugs, bla bla""

-NO

""is there someone nearby that you can call?""

-sigh, sure

""okay, you should go talk to them kthxbye""

No, I know that ultimately, I am the one who should want me to exist, and I shouldn't take life for granted.  BUT, considering the text above and other stuff i haven't mentioned, hitting bottom while successfully making the most improvement i've ever have is 

FUCKING BULLSHIT!!!  WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO ABOUT THAT?! TRY AGAIN?

I cant stop my head from going a mile a second, thinking about all the dumb things i've done in the past, all the people i've alienated and pushed away from me ruining anything and everything that could possibly be good for me. A life filled with regret is what i have. 

last few weeks i was in a much better state, thinking that maybe things would start looking up for me, but it was only a fleeting moment because of course i will ruin whatever semblance of happiness is presented to me. A female friend of an acquaintance showed up and seemingly showed interest in me. I didnt think much of it at first, thinking that its a fluke, becuase of course who could possibly be interested in someone like me. Lo and Behold, a female talking to me showing what i thought to be genuine interest in me. she initiated almost all contact besides the one or two messages i sent to her asking if ""she was coming out tonight""

 after a few weeks of seeing her at all the same events and places that i am, and seeing how she was always hanging out around me, talking to me, dancing with me, etc... I start to get the feeling that perhaps she might just be into me. Oh my a girl who might actually like shitty old me... Nope. Im thinking she is sending all the signals to go in for a kiss, and she just stops me and says ""I like you becuase you arent pushy, you know?"" at this point, becuase im already so screwed up in the head from previous experiences, i cant help but get really upset at myself for thinking what i thought. I immediately shut down socially and i no longer want to be where i am, I am no longer in a good state.

She is not a very stable person. She isn't physically violent and it doesn't appear to be bipolar, but she is very emotionally led and easily agitated. She gets offended easily and expects me to know what she wants without telling me. She's always on the defensive, always closed up and distant. She also hovers and can be smothering at times. She has a low tolerance for frustration and a tendency to take it out on other people. She doesn't think ahead, doesn't consider other people, and doesn't think about consequences of her actions. She is a bit of a hoarder, and has hoarded many material possessions, mostly clothing and furniture that we don't need, to the point that our house is full of excessive clutter. We have few clear surfaces to even set things on. She has even hoarded things like empty cereal boxes, empty jars, etc; I feel like I live in a china shop, because I can hardly move through the house without knocking something over.

She can be very sweet and affectionate when she wants to be, and when the mood strikes her she knows how to say the right things to make you think she is going to try to make an effort to work things out. She never follows through on any of this, however, and her affection is very ephemeral. She is a fair weather friend, except one I'm married to. I have to always be careful around her not to offend or set her off, but I have to take whatever she dishes out without complaining, or she gets even more upset. She also has a tendency to list off all of her/our problems and everything that's not quite right all at once, which feels very overwhelming to me. It's depressing.

She has very little self control. Just now, as I'm typing this, she came in and raved about how our toddler threw something at her and it hit her in the face, so she smacked him in the face and it will probably leave a mark. He has a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Great. I feel like I'm living with a bottle of nitroglycerin with legs.

Of course, I mostly listed off all her negative qualities. She has spent lots of time working with our kid and teaching him, and he has benefited greatly from it.

I've always thought about leaving this world, but only really gotten close to doing it once a long time ago. I have struggled with depression for almost a decade now, and it gets worse and worse each year. I have come to the tip of the ice berg when it comes to my feelings, and emotions, as of today, I can't stand to deal with this constant pain I feel. 
   



 A little back story to where this spiral of emotion started, I work at a store where I met someone who absolutely changed my life. I know it sounds weird but she is about 27 years older than me. Ironically I've known her since I was a kid back in elementary school. She was a friend of my mom's, they met basically waiting out in the halls for the kids to be released. I really became close to this women, she is totally broken, and emotionally spent, but she has helped me through a lot. 
  



  Her ex husband never came back from the service right after his last deployment, he had severe PTSD, and was very mean towards her, and the kids. He left the family, the bills, the house, all to her to take care of while he moved away. I felt terrible when she told me this the first time, and it really made me sad, just a fucked up situation. I have been there for her for a long time where others that should be haven't. I have literally helped her through every problem that she crosses, she is broken. 
    



I fell in love with her, we spent so much time together talking, being with each other, and having fun. Long story short I told her that I loved her like that, and of course I didn't get the reaction I wanted. After all of this everything has gone down hill, it was already killing me everyday when she didn't know that I liked her like that, but now it's worse. We have grown distant with each other, and it sucks. We slowly went from hanging out with the group from work every weekend, to maybe one night a week. We don't talk to each-other much like we used to anymore, and it's all my fault.
  



  I've also been dealing with some close friends who prior to meeting this lady sparked the depression from it's slumber. I literally had about a good year where I was great, and there wasn't a cloud over me, but something happened with former friends, and it just all came flooding back. And after everything was settled I still lived with the clouds, and bad thoughts, and it only got worse with the isolation of my feelings I put myself through when dealing with this lady.  
   



 I've finally come to the realization that this whole time, I feel like I've just been used by her, I won't go into anymore unless asked, but I really am depressed, and want to leave. This has been building up for the past year or so, and I'm at breaking point. So here I sit, drinking a beer I stole from my parents, and staring at a box of pizza I can't force myself to eat. This all probably doesn't make sense, and I'm sorry, but there's a whole story behind it all, and it really belongs in a short book or something to make sense. I am reluctant to post much of it. But I am going to take my life sometime tonight, and I just wanted to be here on Reddit with you guys, for my last day on earth.

I've only ever expressed it to two people, both of which were my girlfriend's at the time, and it was during our breakup.  I've heard from a few people that the types that actually kill themselves are the people that don't say they are, not the ones that talk about it.

I've not been diagnosed with anything, but I know from research and family history that I suffer from bouts of depression and bi-polar disorder.

Some back story on why I frequently think about doing it:
My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me recently and started dating her ex, who I found out was never really out of the picture.  I have a job at a decent company, but it prevents me from going back to school and attaining a degree, thus keeping me from moving up in my job.  My daily job activities are dull and I don't like what I'm doing, but I love the company and it's benefits. I'm in a lot of debt.  I don't have spending money, it all goes to bills.  My car got messed up recently and I don't have money to fix that.  I feel like my friends aren't good enough friends for me to ever mention this to or that they would be supportive if I did.  I don't have the gumption to try and meet new people.

My home life (I'm still with my parents because of my money issue) isn't great.  My dad suffers from bi-polar disorder but refuses to accept the fact and can become verbally abusive to my mother and brother.  My brother suffers from it, but takes medication for it, so it's not so bad.  My mom seems to be at the end of her rope with all of the problems in her life.

I posted in r/relationships under a different account a while ago, but my post was removed for whatever reason, so I didn't get any help there.  Either way, this is a different subject all together.

i'm just having a hard time going through with it. At the same time, I'm having a hard time waiting.

Waiting feels better, because in a few months I'll be away from everyone, and if I die then, it's more convenient for everyone. They won't hear about my death/suicide until months later, when they can more gently grieve.

But waiting also feels pointless. I feel like as soon as I ""test run,"" I'll end up making a test run a final run.

 I just want it to end. But nothing stops the guilt and shame of planning to commit suicide.

It just feels like a waste of time even waiting. If i'm serious, I should do it as soon as possible. i feel like i just need to grow a spine and just do it. i don't want to get better anymore, and I feel guilty about that as well.

It's been better though, because ever since I accepted my suicide, i've reached the acceptance stage of grief. So at least to everyone else, I look better. People have mostly stopped asking if I'm okay, but many probably think i'm just a jerk who avoid's them now.

You'll meet people and not think about the cliques they're in, and the people you found immature will themselves mature. I've had several people bump into me in the pub and apologise to me for their behaviour and strike up conversations.

People turn out to be really nice.

And yes, you're getting to a time when you can define you. Getting a job or joining a group of people who share an interest of yours is a great plan, because even if you don't feel too confident on joining, people remember their first time attending (especially social gatherings) and go out of their way to be welcoming. They'll like you. You seem very considerate- and they *want* to like you. That's why they're there :)

Go home, I don't know how far home is, but buy a plane ticket, drive, whatever. Sit in bed with your cat. NO ONE is going to say that was a bad decision when the alternative was you killing yourself.

Your boyfriend probably has never faced a situation like this before, he is unprepared and scared, and it isn't is fault. I wouldn't necessarily blame him, but unfortunately that means you can't rely on him when you really need him. In addition to the resources in the side-bar, there are of course the on campus counseling which if you are going to take pills or hurt yourself, please talk to them first. You'll have plenty of time afterwards if you still want to carry on with your plan.

Turning here is a good start. A great start in fact. I can't say I've been exactly where you are, because we are different people, but it sounds like we have been in pretty parallel situations. In addition to attempting suicide, I've lost friends to suicide. I would give anything for them to call me or come see me before they did. Anything. Even if it was just to say goodbye and not try and talk them out of it.

Lastly, if you don't want to be where you are in life, change it. Flee the country, the state, the city, go live in the woods for a few days, a week, go crash at a friends house in another state, don't bother telling people where you are or where you are going, let them worry for a little while if you want.

While the few friends I have left have started to get their life properly going. I'm talking girlfriend, engaged, stable job and all that stuff. A regular life.

I've tried it, I don't see the appeal in ever having a girlfriend, yet I'm lonely. I'm also a 22 year old virgin, to me it's quite sad, but I don't let that bother me too much. I don't see myself working a 'normal' job at all. This I've been struggling with since I got my first job in a merch-store. Been through a couple of jobs, IT-support, salesman, restaurant, most recently a food-store, working the floor/register.


I can't see myself doing this for long at all. I don't want a 'normal' life. I just can't stand it, I've been depressed, not a lot for quite some time, lost my father last year, and since then I've literally stopped living. Because for the past year, I've lived off of the money I got from his passing, it's running out soon and I don't want to live, it's getting worse and worse. And today was the first day I actually contemplated on suicide. 

Suicide does not make sense to me, I'm highly logical, but a part of me wants to do it. Just end it. It's been getting worse lately. 

The most frustrating thing is I know a way out, I mean, out of this thing. Getting a normal job and suffering through. But I don't want that, I SO don't want that, thinking about me literally puts me on the edge.

Right now, I'm so lost, I'm not sure what to do. I do know one thing, that I've never lost. What I'd want to be, I've always wanted to be an actor, but I can never see myself doing it, mostly because there is nothing nearby that even puts you in that direction, no school courses or anything.

Also if you school has any counseling services or something along those lines I highly recommend checking it out, I feel that it really helps to talk this over in person with someone. 

Like you I don't have many close friends, in fact I only have 1 (I've been ""betrayed"" by people I thought were my friends before). There's nothing wrong with having few friends, in fact it can lead you to have deeper, more meaningful friendships. However, you say you have troubles meeting people, depending on where your college is from your home, it can be a very scary thing to be in a new place. Depending on how much you enjoyed your high school experience, see if there's anyone from your high school at your college. Recently, I just connected with a girl from my high school via facebook, honestly I had no idea who she was until this semester. She goes to a different (nearby college) but we share that common bond of the same high school and we became friends just like that. 

I'm a social outkast too, the key is not to beat yourself up about it. You're not a freak, you're still human. I think you need to learn to draw some hapiness from within. Sure, hanging out with people is fun, but sometimes you need to chill and learn to be happy with yourself. Mediate, go see a movie by yourself, like some other posters posted go camping, play cards in the lounge or something. Go do something to occupy your mind, not only will you feel better, you'll possibly meet a friend or two. From my experiences, friends pop up in the weirdest of places, and strange times. Don't worry if you don't ""click"", you can't force friendship it takes time to develop.

You aren't gonna feel better instantly, it's a steady progress - ups and downs as I like to call it. Suicide isn't a solution, it just creates another problem. You think you won't be missed but you will, your parents obviously love you and will miss you. I just stumbled upon this reddit community, and they seem like a great group of people, and willing to help. I know this is just a guy on the internet giving you advice, but I've felt the same way.

I'm that person. 

What was said was true: I eliminated my existence online (art sites, reddit, blogger, etc.), all harmless accounts, to please the guy I was dating. I stopped playing video games, drawing, writing, and more, all together. He told me it was all a waste of time, and I wasn't trying hard enough to find work. I since then obsessively increased my hunt. My packed boxes were a reminder of a future I wanted with a man that I thought cared for me-- a man that I wanted to prove my full love to.

I was denied that future. Despite that, the relationship obviously wasn't ALL bad. Or was it? I ask myself that a lot. Did he plan good times just to guilt me about it later? Did he praise my appearance just so it would hurt when he told me my body was used and disgusting? 

Both of us are not perfect people. He believes he is. Be both have faults, admitted to them, and became better people... until he became angry with me for being who I am, and he is perfection once again just because I am more useless than he is. I was not born into riches like he was, I did not get straight A's like he did, I am not the combination of a perfect girlfriend: Pretty, got a lot of money in the bank, super intelligent... Things he seems to want.

Like I said, I am not a perfect being. The times I messed up, he never forgave, nor got over. He convinced himself that I cheated on him... I assume it was to make the break up guilt free. Regardless, I was reminded of my mistakes, both real and fake, constantly. In his mind, everything was worse than it actually was. And he convinced me it was all true by beating it into my head, giving me guilt for both fact and his fiction, turning around and doing nice things for me, then giving me guilt about that.

And I absolutely hate myself. I hate myself for listening to him, and staying with him. While I can sit here and tell you he exaggerated everything bad that could ever happen to him in life, and make up tons of bullshit, I am still programmed to believe everything he said about me was true. I feel like the most physically hideous, stupid, useless person alive. 

Men and women of Reddit, if you ever feel like hurting yourself, or going as far as suicide, and your significant other immediately calls you every synonym of ""crazy"" that they can think of, tell you they can't be with you, insult you in ways that ruin the way you think and live by the hour, get the hell out immediately. Don't be me. Don't throw away almost your entire life away on someone that is so lost in their own world that the mention of a happy moment from the past makes them go, ""It was bullshit."" 

My motivation, to do anything, is gone. I no longer wish to pursue my hobbies, I feel zero motivation when job hunting, and the thought of unpacking those boxes literally makes my stomach cramp. Worst of all, the fact that I can acknowledge his lies but still feel that they are real, makes me wonder how the hell I allowed myself to be this stupid.

I am also disgusted that he went to so much trouble to lie-- so much trouble to make me happier than I had ever been, just to later make it crash and burn. I thought I knew what real love was like, I thought I finally had a shot at a future I always  dreamed about... Nope. I was instead torn down and convinced that I am evil, and if any human ever fucks up at all, well they might as well just die. Because, according to him, people don't change, people can't change. If you're useless, you're useless. Just die.

Needless to say, I currently feel horrified to ever date again. I don't have close friends to talk to anymore; they have all gotten married and moved away. Even if I had someone to speak to, I would most likely be too terrified to talk. I am horrified to trust anyone with anything. I don't even trust myself. I need to go to the store, and have avoided getting in my car because I want to kill myself in a wreck so badly (by hitting a tree or something, not taking out anyone else while on the road). 

This makes me wonder how on earth people go through divorces. I should be glad I didn't move. I should be glad I know what I know now. But I am too damn mad at myself for being fooled for so long.

Does it get better?

Because then I have failed as a father, even if I didn't know.

You know the saying ""ignorance is bliss?"" of course you do.

&gt;The original quote ""If ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise."" The idea was to illustrate that because we &gt;know wisdom is not folly, ignorance should physically pain us. There is a story about Socrates that once a man came to him seeking knowledge. Socrates took him into the sea and held him below the water until he was to the point of death. Then Socrates told the man that when he wants wisdom as much as he wanted to breathe, he would have it. That's what this quote means.The expression Ignorance is Bliss means only that as long as we don't know about something bad it doesn't scare us or make us sad. For all of us engaged in the search for knowledge, ignorance is agony.

I've been suffering from anxiety and depression since I was about 15. I'm not sure how or why it started then but as the years have passed (I'm now 23) it's getting harder and harder to cope with everything. I know there's something wrong with my brain, but I do think my depression comes from real things in the world. My family is lovely in so many ways but it's mainly my parents that have made me feel so ill, through no fault of their own.

My mum has always had mental issues herself. She was adopted at birth and had a very tough life growing up. Her biological mother eventually got sectioned in the 70s when mental illness wasn't understood well enough and died in there. My mum is such a vulnerable person, she's quite simple minded, like when we watch cartoons for children, or even comedy films, she can't understand or follow the story line and my dad always has to explain it to her. I know this sounds ridiculous but it has made me feel so low, because my dad is a smoker, he's been smoking since he was 18 (now 60) and has a terrible smoking cough which I've read is a sign of lung cancer. He refuses to see a doctor about it though, he's really spiritual so he thinks that god is looking over him and will protect him so he continues to smoke and his cough has got worse and worse over the years.

It's this combination that has made me feel so isolated at first, because I know my dad is going to get hospitalised soon. I hear him in the morning coughing up blood and have to put my headphones on to block out the sound. When he dies my mum will lose everything. She doesn't have any friends and my dad is the only person that has ever really understood her and treated her well. I don't know how to talk to her properly because she's not really a real person. She always repeats herself and gets nervous around me even though I'm her son... I've been trying to prepare myself for my dad's death so it's not such a shock when it happens, but it's so hard to even imagine how badly it's going to impact on my whole family. My oldest sister also suffers from depression but she sees a therapist and takes anti-depressants. My family don't really know I'm depressed because I guess I just internalize  it and have tried to sort it out myself. I wake up everyday and it's a struggle to even get out of bed. I just don't see the point. Depression completely consumes you, you can't see a way around it, it's completely absorbing and I just can't imagine how I would ever not feel like this. Obviously its come to a point now where I just can't deal with life anymore. The last 6/7 years have been such a struggle, and I won't put myself through more pain every day. I just can't. It's like I don't have a choice anymore, there's only one option for me. Ive tried to 'self medicate' which has helped me very much to be honest over the last few years, but I can't do that anymore so I really don't have any options. Im scared to tell my parents about my depression because it will worry them so much, it will probably effect my mum and my sister in such a bad way that I wouldn't be able to live with myself anyway. I don't want to take real anti-depressants, i've tried them before and they made me feel even darker and blacker, it took me weeks to recover from feeling that suicidal - they just don't work for it. Last year I went to a skyscraper near my house and just sat there for hours shaking. I couldn't get into the building but my mind was made up at that point. I've got friends and good people around me, but I just can't help feel alone. I get anxiety attacks before seeing my best friends, even though I've known them all my life. I don't understand what's wrong with me, I have so many lovely people around me, so generous and friendly, yet all I feel is black. And I can't pretend anymore.

I don't really know what this message is going to do for me, has anyone had a similar experience where your depressions comes from things around you? I don't think it's biological in my brain because it's real things around me that make me feel suicidal. But then again it must be also because i've found that self-medicatign has actually worked so well. But I can't do that anymore. 

Does anyone have the same thing? I'm from the UK and I know about all the suicide hotlines and MIND but they can't change anything thats happening around me and that's a major reason why I feel like this. I've never been to the NHS for it but I've heard they just treat you like cattle and put you on a conveyor belt when you see a counsellor after a really long waiting list and then they just shove your face with anti-depressants that make you worse. My family is very poor, my mum works so hard doing backbreaking labor because my dad is unemployed, and I don't want to ask to have private care because we just don't have the money for it. My sister and my mum have both been to the priory before but i just can't afford that.

I'm very glad I have a diagnosis as well. I've spent my whole life wondering what was wrong with me. When I finally got diagnosed, it felt very relieving to know that there are other people who feel the same way I do. 

You are right. Some people are just naturally unhappy. I can't do anything to change it. I guess I just assume that if someone doesn't like me, it has something to do with me. To be honest, I can't possibly imagine someone would just not like another person for no reason. I have always liked every single person I have ever met, unless they have wronged me severely.

It sounds like this ex-boyfriend is causing some chaos in your life.  It might be best for your sanity to cut him loose.  If you move out to Oregon and things do not go as planned, you'll end up alone in a strange city.  And trying to force a relationship will only put you in a worse spot.

In fact, you should have someone with you when he comes by to pickup his computer.  Having a friend will help ensure you don't get emotional or try to start up something with the ex.

Please do not cut yourself.  Things will get better.  With your degree, more jobs will become available.  With a new job comes the chance to meet new people.  That will lead to more social events -- happy hours after work, company sponsored events, etc.

Having an outlet to talk will do you some good.  Depression carries a heavy burden.  If you haven't sought professional help, at least try to find a mental health group to join.  Talking with people who are going through the same thing will make you feel better.  One such group is NAMI (nami.org) -- they have regional and local groups with meetings.

Problem is, they live 2,300 miles away from me after my parents decided to move accross the country right after I graduated. 

For the past two years, the entirety of my social life was me and them playing a game called Dota 2 online and over Skype. But it has always been our dream to go to the 18.1 million dollar championships of this game in Seattle, and here we are. My friends drove all of the way from those island to Utah and then to Seattle to see me and to witnesses this amazing experience.

This is supposed to be the happiest week of my life, but all that's on my mind is killing myself when I get home.

Up until my senior year, everyone that I have ever met wanted nothing more than to hate me and tear me to pieces. I've had soup dumped on me, pictures taken just to laugh at my reaction,and shoved so hard I broke a bathroom stall.

And then the only two friends I had joined the bullies and left me alone.

One of the only things that kept me going was some kind of superiority complex. For some reason, I convinced myself to be at least smarter than everyone else that hurt me. I taught myself that I at least had a higher intelligence than average.

But this trip has proven to be the complete opposite.

I've spent the 2,600 hours over the past 3 years learning to play this game, the only social thing I had, with the intention of being the best I can . although we started at the same level, my friends are now a lot better than me, and they have played even less time than myself. I don't know anything and my opinions are always invalid. And coming here to Seattle just enforced that.

Being told I'm wrong is something I have gotten used too. I have decided ADHD and often my behavior is complete trash and annoying, and everyone around me, especially my immediate family, is constantly micromanaging my actions and telling me I'm annoying.

Every single person I have ever met has found me annoying. I'm not smart, I'm constantly being told everything I say or do is wrong, every opinion I have is invalid. 

I'm supposed to be registered for college classes by the next week, but I have desire to be there. All I've ever done is fail at everything I've ever tried to do. If I were to disappear, the only people that would even bother to go to my funeral would be my immediate family, and staying alive for people that constantly call me a failure is no longer worth it.

The only purpose or ability I have to offer humanity is to be a punching bag for them to let out their stress. Now, I do care for my Rhode island friends, but after we all go home I will be left alone again with nothing. No real connections.

I have nothing to offer, I have no drive to do anything, all inhave ever done was fail at the things I've tried my hardest to succeed in
 Everytime I speak my mouth I am met with negative feedback or with disagreement.

I don't think you should be envious of your SO, I don't think it's healthy tbh. Could I ask what your emotional stability is like, are they in a state of constant flux, do you have periods of intense happiness / joy or are you only depressed?
What is the current cause of you depression? Does it all stem back to the loss of attachment you suffered when you partner committed suicide? What are the contributing factors?
There is a lot you can do to improve your mood / mental state that is relevant to all depression (for the most part). Changes in diet to address deficiencies (which can result in depression), exercise and cognitive behaviour therapy (I think this one will be really beneficial to you, there are a lot of self-help books on the subject but sadly I cannot make a recommendation).
The thing is you only want to commit suicide because you are depressed (wow, what insight xD). The longer you stick it out the more likely that is to change and you may reflect on these thoughts and feelings and they may terrify you.
Do you have any family or friends you can reach out to? I think you will have to be careful wrt to your current partner due to his own depression but at the same time he may be able to share some of the advice / help he is being given with you.

I have obsessed about getting this one animal, to the point where I want to blow my brains out.


This has to do with focusing on what I don't have also. The classic not having a girlfriend. I try too hard. I don't know how, but I do. I've never had a girlfriend before, I don't care if it's not all it's hyped up to be; how the fuck would I know that? I have been thinking it's never going to happen.

also i know enough people who hate their jobs but maybe you can focus on doing your job the way to reach your real dreams, your job keeps you busy and gives you money. money is not everything but it will help you to pay for school and with your education you can get something better.
you don't seem like an ugly person, the way you write and express yourself shows that you're smart and in a way it's hard to believe that you are ugly. 
working out will help you lots! i did it myself and you know it was not even about losing the weight, it was just a great feeling i got after i got out of the gym, 30 mins running, that's an accomplishment :)
also a change like moving can help. do you like the area you live in? 
i noticed i was unhappy for a long time and it ended up being more the area than me, sometimes we just don't fit into a certain place.
man i am sorry about that with your girl.
i didn't really get that - does she know you think like that? have you guys talked really open?
you know, my man told me one time: nothing of what i do ever seems to be enough! we talked about that, and it changed everything. and i am thankful he was that open because it also made me understand the mistakes i made. a partner can change a lot if he listens! 

i hope things will turn out good for you!

Recently I had exams. The ones that are supposed to make or break you. The ones that decide which university you go to, which career path yout take, how successful you and society sees you becoming. I worked so hard. Harder than anything else in my entire life. Eight to ten hours locked away in my room with nothing but numbers and formulas. Two months I subjected myself to mind numbing torture but it was for a good cause I thought.

Hard work is supposed to be rewarded right? I did what I was told, the way I was told to do it. It was not my method but it was the method which ""works"" and I could feel that it was. I could see myself getting more and more questions right. I became confident, but made sure not to become overly so. 

I failed. All of them. All of my hard work stomped on and pissed on. Make or break? I broke. All of that hard work. I can't get over it. I don't understand. ""You're smart you just need to work harder"". 

But I did. 

I've just been feeling so...frustrated. I can't explain this feeling. Its a mix of frustration dread depression and engagement of everything in my life which I don't like. Even that which I once did. I can't even explain it to you. It just adds to the fucking feeling that I just cant goddamn explain it to you but what the fuck do I do. 

All I know is that it hurts. 

It hurts so much. 

I want it to stop. Therapy? Even coming up with that idea will make me an even bigger disgrace amongst my family of overachievers. The family of doctors, engineers, professors. And me. Failure. 

I find myself thinking about it. I find myself hurting myself. I find myself losing meaning. Nothing makes sense anymore. The very fundamental law of the universe upon which humanity runs is flawed. *hard work is rewarded*. It would've been helpful if it included the part which said your reward is ceaseless torture which will not let you sleep. Which will not let you eat. Which will not let you think. 

Which will want to make you pull your hair out. Which will want to make you hit your head against a wall. Which will make you question everything you ever understood. Which will mark you as inferior to those around you. 

Its so fucking easy to say that people won't think of you as inferior when you don't already have the entire world thinking of you as a reject. 

As someone who didn't apply himself. 

As someone who didn't push hard enough. 

As someone who should've studied more. 

Am I really better off if I told them I did do all of those things yet still failed? I worked so hard a halfwit could get grades yet I could not? 

But its okay guys. The solution is easy. So simple. So fucking simple isn't it. 

I try again.

But mom I tried my hardest. My very hardest. 

No no you're just being a cynic. *apply yourself*.

I thought I did. 

Work *harder*

And now I'm stuck. Doomed to repeat the same bullshit that put me in this state. Doomed to repeat myself because there is no other option. 

I can't drop out and become successful. 

I'm not innovative. 

I'm not smart. 

I'm just doomed. 

Can someone please explain what I'm feeling. I've described it and the events that led to it as best as I can alongside my current situation. The feeling is only growing stronger please help me. I remember a time where I didn't want to kill myself. Now is the time I'm not so sure what I want.

I'm dreading the day that I do. 

Please help me. ",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,self,"I don't understand what I'm feeling or what happened to me, but I can't stand it.",3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2dofhm/i_dont_understand_what_im_feeling_or_what/,

Let me first say that I am a 19 year old man currently in college. I have been having on and off suicidal thoughts for a couple of years; usually I get past them, but lately I feel myself getting closer and closer to actually killing myself. I spend hours thinking about what to say in a suicide note and I get this feeling that just ending everything would leave me with no more pain. There has only been two things I've ever been super passionate about in life those are being a great dad and being a great husband. I have never been ambitious, I don't care about achievement, or money. I coasted through school because I didn't care and I was smart enough to get b's with absolutely no work. I'm doing the same thing in college right now. I have no clue what I want to major in or do for the rest of my life. I'm currently unemployed and I have never held a down job down longer than 3 months without quitting. I'm not motivated about bettering myself and I don't really take pride in hard work. I feel like a lazy parasite who only survives based on  the support of others without any independence of my own. It takes months for me to do anything in my life such as schedule a doctors appointment or getting car insurance. I hate myself for it, but I also kind of like having no responsibilities and nothing to worry about. I have really bad anxiety new work settings, new people, they all terrify me. The anxiety is worse when I'm around men. I'm a little bit more sensitive and emotional than most of the men I know and I get such a huge sense of inadequacy when around them. I'm fairly short, small, and I have no common sense or knowledge of stereotypical ""man"" things. I get terrified of looking like a fool in front of people and I shut down. This fear keeps me from doing so many things. I feel like I've fallen short of everything my family, friends, and loved ones have expected of me. My father was a great tennis star and beautiful singer, my grandfather was a brilliant band instructor and composer, and my other grandfather was a literal genius who worked for NASA. I will never stack up to that not only because I lack the skills and talents, I lack the drive. I don't want to end my life because I'm sad or my situation is bad. I know things like that change. I just feel fundamentally wrong, like I will never be more than a parasite on society unable to do my part. My girlfriend is loving and supportive and she would be devastated if I did something like kill myself as would my friends and family. I also know I that I would miss out on having the family that I've always wanted and never had. But honestly how good of a father or husband be without being able to support his family. I could write a ten page essay on how I feel, but I guess this is as good a place as any to cut off.

It did NOT go well.

I have quit drinking. Not a drop since noon. I chose to stop, and it is working out well so far. I feel fantastic, though really shaky at times. My hubby didn't take the news so well and we had a huge fight in the therapist's office and I sobbed through the whole thing. I made it this far, though, and I intend on staying sober from now on. 

I quit because it was the right thing to do.

I got hell from the therapist about taking my meds and drinking, so that was the whole problem. I deserved that. I was actually able to take my night-time medicine just about a half hour ago and not have to worry about it. I am getting sleepy from them now, and it feels good to be back on them fully and willingly.

It feels great to be sober.

Oh, and the suicidal thoughts have NOT really come back, even when my hubby was screaming at me!!! I thought about it for a millisecond, and it wasn't that I wanted to do it, but more of a ""gee, at an earlier time, I would be running for the pills or noose or something...but I really don't want to hurt myself!"" kind of thought.
I am extremely proud of myself for quitting and also for sticking with this and NOT resorting to self-harm or suicide.

Go me!!!

(By the way, hubby seems to have gotten over it and I have a psych appointment where I have to convince them that I don't need further help...which I don't since I have quit on my own) so I think I can do that and convince the Psych PA tomorrow.)
Wish me luck for tomorrow. As for withdrawals, I think I was truly scared sober and I don't have any cravings or bad symptoms except for a little shaky in the hands. I am extremely lucky that I stopped when I did--before I had gotten myself TOO far in and unable to stop.

Thanks for the support guys.

Your just looking for the easy way out if you are infact going to do it.  I have a proposal for you.  Wait,  despite how hopeless it feels how horrible shit has been wait.  For what you might ask?  Many people think the world is going to end by the end of this year.  I propose you wait until that time to decide afterall you must have been miserable for years to even consider this,  whats 9 more months then?  Here are the possible outcomes.  
1. In 9 months time you find something life changing and regain your former happiness.  
2.  You get a front seat to the most amazing apocalyptic show the world has to offer.   
3.  Nothing has improved in your life and the world keeps turning just as it always had but you at least got to see the look on those suckers faces who threw it all away thinking the world was coming to an end.  

I never claimed I was good at this nor that I would actually help you but instead I challenge you.  Will you deny yourself this one last challenge?  This one last good fight.

To me it also makes little sense on paper. It certainly isn't a science of any kind. And anti-depressants are also horribly flawed; they seem like the neuropsychological equivalent of chemotherapy. Lots of side-effects, and the disease can come back any time and metastasize out of proportion.

There is a lot of promise on the horizon however. Depression really is a disease, and medical research marches on.. Lot of money staked on this one. Would life seem worth it if you could hope that in 10 years time, there would be a real cure?

Anyway, the reason I so stubbornly try to convince you not to do it is because I know from second-hand personal experience that it doesn't have to end here. 

My mother attempted suicide when I very young. Luckily, she was caught with her head in the gas oven just in time. Spent months or years institutionalized, had tons of therapy and countless medication.

Today, she doesn't see any therapists and takes no antidepressants, but she seems genuinely happy, and I am really relieved that she made it through. In her case, she was saved by her own personal Jesus... I know, this obviously doesn't appeal to you, and it really doesn't appeal to me either.

He's a transitional male to female (I think thats the term for It I really dont know its not something I'm well versed on), He's always been a ""troubled"" kid in the sense that hes always had problems with his family and is extremely emotional to a fault. He's really ""out there"" really weird personality that at first I gelled with since I am kind of odd myself but he's like wayyyy out there (the y's denote how far out he is). He used to be / still is a cutter (not too sure if he still does but his scars are noticeable), and in general since I got back from college he seems to always have something to complain about to me. He's not going to school (he never gave a shit about school and would get f's with maybe a C), is working a dead end job that he usually skips a shift every week or so due to something ( one week it was his hands, the other week he said he couldnt even deal with it, one time it was his feet, I think he just looks for excuses to not go), smokes about six grams of weed a week (says he ""needs"" to even though I know thats bullshit), is a near pack a day smoker, and is seemingly an extremely unmotivated person. His social circle outside myself is a bunch of burn outs, druggies or dealers, He over dramatizes almost every plight in his life to a point where small hardships like going to work, doing chores, talking to parents, having disagreements with friends becomes these huge issues that fester and grow on him to the point where he would rather avoid them and bitch about it then actually do something. He very recently (past few days) tried to kill himself, I'm not sure how since he didnt divulge it to me, but he told me on the phone when I asked him why and he thinks that his life is just one big failure and that all the compound stress of his home life and his job made him want to kill himself. I told him their is no reason to see himself as a failure, that is he devotes himself to something and sticks with it he will see the real worth in life but he seemed to just pass that by.  



I dont really know how to handle the situation, as when I try to logically think about it many of his problems are self caused: his home life is a mess because he nevers wants to do anything his mom tells him (cleaning a pig sty room, doing yard work, basic things) so shes snaps at him and he in turn flys off the handle and they argue over a really simple thing, his job is stressful because he doesnt like it and seems to constantly try to find reason to want to quit, and he seems to hate everyone he hangs out with except me because they are all just shitty people. I've told him numerous times to find stress releasing exercises, whether its meditating, or actually working out but both of these options hes found a way to mentally edge away from because he ""cant be sore from working out when on the job because it makes it too stressful"" which I dont get, because he constantly bitches about being overweight for his height and not having energy. I've tried to talk to him about cutting back on smoking weed, as he sees it as his only stress releasing option and he complains about not having money due to smoking so much, I've even tried to lead by example and stop smoking to show him its completely doable but he says without it he'd probably go through killing himself. I've talked about him about going to see a psychiatrist about these glaring issues but he's been in a mental ward before and has this extreme skewed view against any and all psychiatric practitioners.         


I dont mean to just dump this on people here, but I'm kind of at the end of my rope with him, every conversation we have seems to be about how hes not happy and how his life is so shitty, and every time I tell him that many of his issues can be changed by himself he either doesnt believe me or just chooses not to listen. I feel like its honestly been really off putting to hang out with him, to the point where sometimes the only reason I do is because I know I'm pretty much the only friend he has that will even listen to him. I've thought about talking to his family about his recent suicidal incident but all I've figured that all that would do is bring about him actually killing himself or him forever resenting me, and at this point I think I would rather him hate me and be alive than die with me being his last best friend.  


If anyones had to deal with this or been in a situation like this that could help me out, I would be eternally grateful, some of my friends that arent in his social group say I should just not hang out with him since he's such a odd ball and negative and pretty toxic presence as all he wants to do is smoke weed, play video games, or bitch about shit (and the sad thing is they are right about that much), or they just tell me he needs serious psychological help, which I agree on but I know he wont actually go to one.

I have friends, but no 'close' friends. I don't have anyone that I can talk and feel comfortable with.

The fact is that I'm a very emotional person, and I need to have deep connections with people that I trust.. I used to have friends like this but we have parted our ways. I don't feel this way with my family, nor any of my friends, nor coworkers.. and it seems that the more I try to find someone that I can be open with, the more desperate I get, and I end up driving away perfectly good friends because I just want more out of them than they can give me.

24894,,False,sugarbear513,,,,"I hear you, OP. That's a totally normal response to being in that environment for so long. Her behavior is a reflection of her though, not you. Her words are NOT truth. And they are definitely not YOUR truth. 
The big question is, what would you like your story to be? When you daydream about what the next phase of your life could be like, what do you see? Even if it's just a little hint. Because I believe that the first step in anything is determining a desired outcome. That way you always have a benchmark to ask yourself ""am I getting closer or farther away from my desired outcome with my behavior right now"". Guess what. You're currently kicking ass because collaborating with others is absolutely you getting closer to what you want (whatever it might be). Now let's examine her behavior. Is she trying to get you to do some certain thing or at least stay married? How effective is her behavior really? Is she accomplishing any of that? Yeah not so much, huh. Could she even be any more wrong in her approach? 

So the next question is what tools are in your area that you can take advantage of to get even closer to your desired outcome? I'm still going to recommend giving the hotline a buzz. Even if it's just to call and say ""hey I'm looking to start rebuilding me and my daughter's life after an extended abusive relationship. Can you give me a list of relevant local resources?"" 
What about getting a recommendation letter from your landscaping employer or a trusted friend? If the unemployment isn't sufficient to carry you and your daughter through, what types of jobs in your area do you have skills and potential at? I can say right now I know you're a hard worker. Landscaping in blistering sun all day everyday is hard as fuck. And I can tell by this brief exchange that your writing abilities are impressive and you're a problem solver. You're also adept at talking with strangers, which means you probably have great customer service skills. You have a lot to offer any organization that needs an intelligent, problem solving hard worker with grit and social skills. Do you have a resume? Resources exist for helping you perfect that as well.  
One thing that really helped me reconnect with myself after my own abuse-filled past is volunteer work. I know you're thinking ""fuck. I'm saying I need help, not I have energy to spare"". But the reason it helped me is because I, for the first time in a long time, was able to see people appreciating what I have to offer. And I woke up with a sense of purpose those days and went to sleep with a sense of accomplishment. That organization will also serve as a reference for you. I used a site called volunteermatch.org to find a whole slew of opportunities. 

Let me ask you this. What would you say to the older version of your daughter if she called you and said ""daddy he's hitting me and I have no money, I'm trapped""? After you convinced yourself to set the shotgun down, you'd be thinking waaaay outside the box about what tools could be used to get her out of there, right? Or what if a friend called you and said the same thing? Try and close your eyes and see this scenario from a more objective point of view. One day at a time, OP. One day at a time and one step at a time. Just remember, that 5 year old doesn't look at you and see money or your past. She sees the strongest man on the planet.

It never bothered me because when you're a kid, you don't worry about crap like that.  13 years of school? That'll take forever!  I have plenty of time to worry about that.  Then time passes and people start asking you about college and what major you want to pursue.  That troubled me all through high school.  I enrolled at a particular college (which is a good school, not blaming it on my problems, I just disagree with the college system in general), and started out getting all of my required classes out of the way, not yet knowing what major to go with.  Two years later, most of those classes are out of the way: Now what?  My dad steered me toward a business degree.  I didn't have any better ideas.  That is about when I started skipping classes and disregarding homework assignments.  I would seriously rather be dead than work in an environment like that.  Any number of jokes and memes have arisen based on the jargon of the modern workplace environment.  See Weird Al's ""Mission Statement"".  Those words make my skin crawl.  So I switched to Social Sciences because I enjoyed History, and all History classes I've had in the past.  But by that point, I had already given up hope on any kind of enjoyable career, or a future at all, for that matter.  These days I don't really enjoy much.  Sure, I still have entertainment.  But I don't have the same desire to read that I used to.  Videogames aren't the same level of fun.  Porn isn't as appealing as it used to be.  I still spend time with my friends and put on a façade, but it still feels off.  Like it's always in the back of my mind.  I don't think they know if anything is off.  We generally try to stay off serious topics.

When we're young, we're presented with a misleading, romanticized version of what careers (and life) are.  Being a doctor has nothing to do with helping sick people.  It becomes a power trip, holding people's lives in your hands, knowing you're smarter than the patient and their families.  Or it becomes a life of stress due to endless policies and regulations, insurance fiascoes, malpractice lawsuits, years of additional schooling, and I could go on.  (Forgive my cynicism, I'm sure people do actually care about people.)  And yet children's programs continue to force feed their watered-down bullcrap.  Screw those happy people at their happy jobs!  At this point I feel I may have gotten off-topic, but whatever.  There might have been a point to that.  I don't know.

15 years old.
Never had any real friends.
I have nothing to look forward to.
I don't do anything but wake up, play on my PC, and cry myself to sleep.

Note that I'm bad at explaining things, so please bare with me.

I don't even know what the fuck is wrong with me. I get angry at the slightest things. Not just frustrated, but nearly punch a hole in the wall each time, which had been done. Then I'm happy for 2 minutes. Am I bipolar? No idea. 

I hardly eat anything but cereal in the morning. 

I don't even shower anymore, once a week at most normally. I have no reason too, I stay inside wearing the same clothes all day everyday anyway.

Parents get mad at me because I never leave the basement. I don't like anything so there is nothing else for me to do. 
Parents are no help. When they hear me get angry they just tell me to shut up and call me crazy in our native language.

I have been taking anxiety meds for around a year and a half and it had not done shit, so I occasionally vape weed, which is the only thing that has been keeping me sane. I'm going to say that without it I would have already gone crazy. Occasionally = once every week or two, max.

Depressed for the past two years. Every time I show any signs of it, it's always ""Oh, he's still young it's just hormones"" or ""What the hell is wrong with you? Stop crying and getting mad just because of X"" along with calling me crazy as said earlier.

I wish I was strong enough to do it. I wish I was strong enough to take my own life, right now. I'm too chickenshit to cut, scared of any side effects of meds, no guns in the house, nothing.

127285,,True,esther_mouse,,,,"Hey, this sounds like something you might find it helpful to talk to a therapist about. It's actually not at all unheard of to have thoughts that might make you feel ashamed or ""bad"" - if it's something you can't control, that is negatively affecting your life, they might be [intrusive thoughts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_thoughts). You're not alone, and you're not a freak! You're not a sick pervert! You know that it would be wrong to act out these thoughts and recognise that they're just in your head, so please don't be too harsh on yourself here, and realise that other people experience this too, to varying degrees. Also realise that therapy probably really can help you with this, if you're willing to let it.

Here's a relevant excerpt from that wiki page which might comfort you a little (in realising that this isn't your fault and doesn't make you ""sick""): 

&gt;When intrusive thoughts occur with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), patients are less able to ignore the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing.[1] The thoughts may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy.[5] Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.

&gt;How people react to intrusive thoughts may determine whether these thoughts will become severe, turn into obsessions, or require treatment. Intrusive thoughts can occur with or without compulsions. Carrying out the compulsion reduces the anxiety, but makes the urge to perform the compulsion stronger each time it recurs, reinforcing the intrusive thoughts.[1] According to Baer, suppressing the thoughts only makes them stronger, and recognizing that bad thoughts do not signify that one is truly evil is one of the steps to overcoming them.[9] There is evidence of the benefit of acceptance as an alternative to suppression of intrusive thoughts. A study showed that those instructed to suppress intrusive thoughts experienced more distress after suppression, while patients instructed to accept the bad thoughts experienced decreased discomfort.[10]

&gt;These results may be related to underlying cognitive processes involved in OCD.[11] But, accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as ""the doubting sickness"";[12] the ""pathological doubt"" that accompanies OCD can make it harder for a person with OCD to distinguish ""normal"" intrusive thoughts as experienced by most people, causing them to ""suffer in silence, feeling too embarrassed or worried that they will be thought crazy"".

I'm not saying you have OCD, as intrusive thoughts certainly aren't limited to a specific mental disorder, but please know that other people struggle with this too, it's not really uncommon, and if it's genuinely distressing or scary to you, even a little bit, then a proper therapist can probably help quite a bit!

One more thing to bear in mind, from that same article:

&gt;The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low. Patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over these thoughts are different from those who actually act on them. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.

Edit: Just to add one more thing which may hopefully provide some comfort - I'm a woman who has been abused sexually in the past, not something I open up about much, but I'm still talking to you here, and offering my empathy and perhaps some understanding, rather than disgust or fear, because I don't see you as being anything like the person who hurt me, from what you've written. I really hope you manage to feel better about yourself soon, please take care!

Edit edit: One more thing, since I keep checking back and noticing things I missed - about having no friends, and not knowing how to make any - believe me when I say that having people around you who you like and trust can REALLY help to sort out your mind a bit. I'm not hugely social and only in the last couple of years have I made real life friends (I'm 25), and it's definitely made me a lot more comfortable around people and helped my thoughts to ""settle down"", for want of a better phrase. I don't obsess over person-related things quite so much anymore, as it becomes more comfortable and routine just to ""be"" around people. I don't have any advice on meeting people, other than perhaps you could try chatting online to people who are into similar things - perhaps some of them will turn out to live close by, and you could go out to some gigs or something together. It's a good place to start, because with loud music and a couple of beers the pressure to make conversation isn't too high (or so I find).",,0.0,,2013-10-28 07:00:23,,,0,1382944071,,,,0,,cd17dkk,,,,,t3_1pd0ax,,,t1_cd17dkk,,,,t3_1pd0ax,,,,,,,,1428957070.0,,4,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,4,,

--Posting from a throwaway account so I don't get any more hatred from those in my life

I know nothing but hatred, suffering, and an endless fight against depression and I truly believe I am unhelpable. I have fought my entire life, from as early as I can remember, to try and seek some form of happiness, and relief from depression and my many other issues.

I have tried absolutely everything. From trying over 20 different ""professionals"" that think I am some sort of bad person or joke to be laughed at, or just shove pills at me and tell me they might help when I've tried too many to even count. 

None of them work or help in any way, from talking to hundreds of people online, to self-help positive thinking, to trying pretty much every hobby that exists that I can access, the ONLY result I can come up with is that I'm unhelpable.

I have many, MANY mental, physical, emotional and other issues, too many to list here, and everyone thinks I'm some sort of joke. And even if they take me seriously, there is absolutely nothing any caring person can do for me, as I have truly tried everything, and am unhelpable.

I have gone through nothing but mental and emotional abuse my entire life from nearly every single 
person I have ever met in my entire life, both online and offline, from my religious parents, to my so called ""friends"".

I've had hundreds that end up just telling me I'm a bitch or some other insult even after knowing me for years, over the most petty reasons from being bad at some online game, to accidentally spilling something on the floor, and then proceeding to completely and totally go crazy, absolutely destroying me piece by piece, telling me each and every thing that's awful about myself and so on.

I've never truly enjoyed anything in my entire life, and I've tried pretty much everything I have access to. From physical activities like sports, running, exc to no-lifing video games, to mental
imagery, meditation, imagination, activities with others, activities alone, it's just too much to mention.

I have had at best, a very short few minutes of what I can only assume is happiness, as it is a high unlike no other, because my entire life I feel nothing but sadness, and endless hatred for this world and everyone in it due to my experiences in life.

It is as if I am cursed, to suffer for all eternity or something. I'm not good at anything, even after working ridiculously hard and practicing for many many years at any task I can think of,
but that is most likely because I quite literally enjoy nothing. 

I do stuff to pass the time, but I truly don't enjoy anything, and I've tried pretty much everything I have access to. I have no passion or desire or dream or enjoyment for anything, never have.

The only reason I'm still here is because of some blind hope that something will improve in the distant future. It's a miracle I'm still alive, and not in a mental asylum or jail or something.

The majority of people, when I tell my story, think that I'm lying in some way, or not believing that I truly don't enjoy anything, exc but I'm not.

I've battled with suicidal thoughts my entire life, and have successfully fought them off.. for now. I've looked for other options my entire life, nothing but suffering, and I have not found any hope for me now, or even in the distant future. I try to stay positive, but it's nearly impossible sometimes. I don't know what to do. I'm going to crack eventually.

Does anyone here, have any answers, or even a slight bit of hope? I've tried everything I can possibly think of, and studied and researched about everything I can.

I'm the guy who made fun of people for their problems, their actions, and their feelings.  Then I ran smack-face first into them myself and maybe it is my comeuppance.

Gosh, where to start.  The beginning?  That's complicated, but okay.

The first time I fell in love, I was five years old.  Impossible? Maybe.  Traumatic? Definitely.  At an early age, I guess I developed some sort of hero complex.  I don't know why.  Maybe it was because my mother needed saving.  She was dying of emphysema by the time I was old enough to form memories.  She decayed in front of me, and I couldn't do anything.  I think that is probably why my hero complex developed.

I should note that I am adopted.  My parents, the ones who adopted me, did everything they could to adopt a child.  When they finally got the approval from the state, they were too old to adopt a newborn, so they were left with the only option left, a toddler.  That was me.

I don't remember my birth mother.  I have some odd vague memories of what I can only imagine is of the foster family I lived with, but the memories are so confusing that I can't piece them together.

They saved me, so I should save others, right? I guess.  My first girlfriend at five years of age was kind of the ugly duckling.  I don't even know why I liked her, but I did.  Once I made it public that she was my world, everyone made fun of me. How could I love the ugly girl, when so many pretty girls were vying for my attention.  I didn't understand the dynamic.  I was five years old.

Peer pressure caused me to dump her, and move onto the pretty girls.  Society chose pretty versus ugly, I just followed it.  I became part of the crowd that gave her hell for being ugly...

It was a lie.

I did like her.  I guess I loved her.  I'll never forget the moment.  I rose to the rank of alpha-male within the group.  Others worshiped me. I was their false idol.  One night, as the old rickety church van dropped me off at my house, I was embroiled in a moment with her.  She was crying, I was trying to apologize for being a dick-face.  She looked at me and said ""So you care about me  But you don't love me?""

That moment...Fuck me sideways.  In that single sentence, that single moment, I loved her.  I kissed her, even though she had half a Star Crunch in her mouth.  I kissed her.  And cryptically I said ""But I do...""  And it my stop.  The van had reached my destination.

I meant it.  I really had always loved her.  I guess it was the childhood love.  At thirteen, I dreamed of the moment when I would turn fourteen and could get a motorcycle license so that I could drive to her house.  At fourteen, I realized my parents were not going to let me get a motorcycle license....or buy me a motorcycle.

At fifteen, I dreamed of the day when I would get a car.  At fifteen and a half, she moved away.  Somewhere in there, she met someone else.  Fell in love.  Then he died in a car accident.  She came back to town as I turned sixteen or so.  I had a car, but wasn't allowed to drive it until I proved I was responsible.

She randomly contacted me one night.  I was sixteen or seventeen, I can't remember which.  She told me about the shit she had been through, some really crappy stuff.  Asked if I could meet her.

I didn't hesitate.  I rushed to her.  I still loved her.  Hero complex, right?  She had changed.  Instead of being the victim.  She was now the aggressor.  She made fun of me for getting fat.  Told me that I didn't really compare to her previous boyfriend who had died in a car accident.  Etc.  Etc.  Etc.  

I was devastated, but it was the moment that allowed me to temporarily get over her.  Enough that it let me enjoy high school.  I didn't hear from her much after that.  I went on to date other girls, purge myself of her memory, and get on with my life.  Two proms.  Graduation.  College.  Moved out, started my life.

One day when visiting my parents, my dad said some girl had called for me.  He barely uttered a syllable of her name before I was leaping across the room to rip the number out of his grasp.  It was her.

So I saved her again.  She was destitute.  Living in a trailer, barely able to eat.  I spent every day with her.  Bought her food.  Bought everything she needed.  I took care of her.  I fell in love with her all over again.

Until...that night.

Runaway Bride - That was the movie.

When we were kids, I had walked five miles to Wal-Mart and shoplifted this really crappy fake engagement ring that was on the $3.99 wrack.  After giving that to her, another girl who was interested in me had forcibly taken it from her.  I found an exact duplicate of that ring and bought it. 

I wanted the duplicate to be a surprise.  To be a ""hey - remember this"" -- Nope.  Not my luck.  When I produced it, she freaked the fuck out  Apparently, she didn't remember the gift I gave her as a kid.  She thought I was actually proposing.  Before I had a chance to explain, she ran upstairs in my place.  

I was so lost.  So heartbroken.  I went into the room with her.  I closed the door.  I told her I loved her.  I told her I always loved her.  She said she wasn't worth loving  She said she was ugly and I couldn't love her.  I pulled her in front of a mirror.  I told her that what she was looking at was my vision of perfection.  Everything i ever loved.  Everything I ever wanted.

She couldn't grasp it.  She told me I was a fool.  She told me she was leaving.  I placed my hand on the door.  I told her that if she opened that door, I would say goodbye.  I would let her go.

She cried.  She told me that she didn't love me like I loved her.  She told me she was my friend, but nothing more.  She left.

I can't even tell you how long I cried....

That was 11 years ago.

TLDR time:

* Sick of each other's shit, I'm supposedly moving out
* She's making it impossible (""you have to leave now"" vs ""I need all of your money"")

I feel like there's no alternatives left, and that it's time to check out. I've faced similar feelings before, but the thought of ""what about the kids?"" has always been a bit of a grounding point.

i face an end.  i'd have to re-live my past again.  i'd have to let her go, just like i let my little boy go, so she would be taken care of.  no emergency place.  like a death sentence to live without her.  she's my greatest motivator, a ball of love and happiness and joy.  i took it all for granted.  i took everything for granted.  and now i'm just.. so tired.  feel tired.  not physically, but mentally.  my mind, my heart, demolished, and to exist without her... the mere thought is miserable, but i'll have to do it.  i'll have to hand her over, and give up, and be a failure.

never good enough.  just a bitch, a low life, a fuck up, and i'm never good enough.  just some.. piece of shit.  it's all said and done.  all said and done, and there's no turning back.  consequences to actions, and i just don't.. want to live, y'know?  too chickenshit to do it, but the thought itself persists and it's bugging me but it just feels so nice to think about for a while, just.. not existing.  she could have a better mom.  he would find a good mom for her.  she has a big enough family, and i am easily replaceable.  she deserves better, and i don't know if i can give that to her anymore.  i'm too worthless, too... horrible of a person. i'm.. scum. i'm a charity case gone awry, and i've taken up too much space and too much time.

like.. i feel like everything was wasted. no lessons learned.  just another bridged burned, another failure, another hopeless notch on my bedpost that i had hoped would last forever, that i wouldn't put any more notches there.  he'd be my last.  he'd be my forever.

oh god, i remember the beginning, like blaring images in my head.  fucking walmart of all places, what the fuck.  like who the fuck has fun at walmart.  we did, though.  and it was wonderful.  but we're not the same people.  life changes.  we change.  i get worse.  he gets fed up.  i don't blame him, and i don't think i ever did, even though i tried so i could sleep better.

but i'm so consumed with this guilt.. this.. misery, because it's my fault that it turned out this way, and i trashed so many things because i just couldn't control myself anymore.  never could.  i'm just a goddamn toddler stuck in a woman's body.  

and then i flash back again, to us, to.. everything.  and i realize, fuck, it's just so goddamn hopeless, so much time wasted for.. nothing.  no reason.  and here i sit, facing my end, the end of all things i ever came to know within the past year.  so attached.  but it's all meaningless, and maybe in the end, it will be my true end.  maybe i'll stop being so chickenshit and do it. do everyone a fucking favor.  it'll improve the lives of others.  some may suffer for a bit, but less than i already made them suffer.  they'll get over it.  they'll die off, and my name will be lost after their last breath.

it's all done.  he's gonna fuck someone else and tell them he loves them and it will kill me.  maybe that'll be the thing that will push me over the edge, make me stop being afraid.  her not around, him fucking someone else. it's such a fucking waste.  fuck fuck fuck fuck

I mean emotional pain, sadness, loneliness, and isolation. Some people just lack the ability to connect with other people, and therefore will always have this agonizing loneliness and despair.

Sure they may find someone, but it won't last. ""Normal"" people don't want to be around people like that for too long. Once they pick up on the fact that you're a social outcast, they will leave you to be amoung the normies. And the fact that they were ever with you for that short period of time is a sheer miracle.

Some people are simply too ugly, maybe even deformed with a birth defect, and they too involuntarily end up being social outcasts. This is perhaps the worst kind of pain, because you miss out on a major source of joy that is also in fact a human need, because of factors beyond your control.

Another thing I wonder is why people get so offended at the idea of suicide, like its an insult to the life we were given. Some people are just destined to be unhappy and lonley, why are they expected to just carry on and paste on a fake smile?

It sounds like you're more conflicted than you're able to let yourself process right now, possibly because you're trying to hold onto that energy?

&gt; The reason it doesn't really affect me as well is because I am now essientailly desensitized of the matter of suicide.

::nods:: I can tell that, and that's part of what worries me so much.

&gt; It's not that I don't see me having a future but just a really negative one. I see myself as being a programmer or being in the IT because computers are primarily my biggest area of knowledge. I really don't want to go down that path but it seems that will be my future career.

I'm curious why you don't want to go down that path? (It's totally fine not to, of course!) Is there another one you wish you could take?

&gt; Obviously I can change this with either working out and getting that runners high, possibly even getting rid of low motivational status and deprived energy, however with my current mindset this is totally out of reach.

Learning and changing your way of life *is* tough, especially if you're in the middle of depression.

&gt; I really wish I could get treatment and continue my life in a positive manner.

May I ask what's holding you back from doing this?

Lastly: you're not just an anonymous life to me, you're a well-spoken, insightful, compassionate young adult who takes joy in life and is part of a community of friends and family, who's concerned about their future and surrounded by thoughts of suicide and an energy that threatens to carry them through.

the only thing you should make sure is, that you - at least - include one more or less constructive phrase into the PM, since your intention is not solely insult the advice-giver, but to make him see, that he misses the appropriate empathy.",,0.0,,2015-02-07 14:33:17,,,0,False,,,,0,,coe2h9w,,,,,t3_2v2o8i,,,t1_coe2h9w,,,,t3_2v2o8i,,,,,,,,1424092299.0,,9,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,9,,

To cope in the meantime, about three weeks ago I started drinking. Hard. Anywhere from 4 to 7 shots of 80 or 90 proof straight from the bottle, no meal or mixer.

And now all of a sudden, I feel ""normal."" ""better"". ""functional."" I feel like I could try to do things again and make something with my life.

But honestly, I don't want to anymore. That little piece of me that says ""I want to get better, keep going, whatever,"" feels broken, and I don't know that I want to fix it anymore. I've spent so long just wishing my life would end, not get better, just end, that feeling ""good"" all of a sudden, for a few days, feels worse than feeling bad before. At least then, I knew what I wanted.

But now I'm not even sure if I can kill myself, and that hurts even worse, and makes me upset and angry with myself. I feel guilty too...because I know I *should* try to do things and *could* do them if I tried hard enough, but that part of me doesn't want to keep going anymore.

Between the guilt, the suicidal desires, and knowing that once I stop drinking I'll probably go back to where I was....and keeping having to think ""You can do things now, you should follow your dreams"" or whatever....it's just confusing. I want to die, and now I ca'nt even do that.

I guess I jsut didn't know who else to go to.

I had a very rough weekend and didn't really think I was this depressed. I guess I was just lying to myself. I'm an early 20's male I have a chronic illness and I don't plan to live much into my 50s. I helps mentally and physically disabled people for a living. I don't know if I want to do that for whats left of my life, but ever since I was small I've known that I wanted to be a dad. I've been feeling down and lonely lately but the events that happened over the weekend caused my first suicide thought in about 2 years.

It all started off this weekend when I threw a party for the 4th. I have a chronic illness and shouldn't drink so I decided to be the DD. Well everything was going great and the party was starting to whined  down when I decided to start taking friends home. My first friend one of the best was way to drunk to remember anything, but he yelled at me many times on the way home. Its not like him to do that at all. He told me to shut the fuck up. I honestly don't know what caused him to do this. Well finally got him home and took others home who where happy for me to drive. Finally it was me and this girl I like that I was taking home last. She seemed like she was in a fantastic mood until she grabbed something out of my center counsel and pretended to cut herself. Now I know she has been struggling lately too so I decided to come up to her apartment and make sure she is ok. Once we got into the apartment she tried to kiss me and I told her no that she was drunk and it was wrong. Well she wanted a pizza so I started the pizza and I heard her run into the bathroom. I went in there and I noticed she had cut herself with the razor. We talked in the room for a awhile until we come out for pizza. She ate some pizza and insisted to have some more beer. She said she had to go to the bathroom and I though she calmed down so I let her go in there. After a few minutes I knocked and there was no answer so I tried to open in and I noticed it was locked. I heard her start to cry and I begged her to open the door. She finally did and there was a lot of blood. She cut herself deep in the leg. Well we sat in there and talked more. I cleaned up all the blood. After awhile I talked her into going to bed. She asked me to stay in her bed. After she kept insisting she wouldn't go to bed till I did I finally did. We sat there and talked and slowly the lights got turned off and she laid down. We then decided to talk about how we used to have feelings for one another when we where smaller. She then tried to kiss me again and this time I didn't say no. After a minute or so we stopped and we laid there. I thought she fell asleep so I got up to go crash on the couch. She heard me get up and asked where I was going. I told her and she told me to come back. After a few minutes she told me she would never be able to fall asleep without going to the bathroom. I told her to go. Well I thought she was fine but she cut herself again. I cleaned her again and the sun was rising now so we went outside and sat there for a few minutes. When we got back inside one of her roommates was up. We told him what happened and he didn't say much. He then went outside for his cigarette. She then said that she needed to go to the bathroom again. This time I told her I needed to go first. I went in the bathroom grabbed the razor and quickly searched for others. I couldn't find any so I let her go in. I went to go sit on the couch and after a few minutes she still didn't come back I went to go open the door and it was locked. This time I wasn't getting an answer when I asked. I got the roommate and he didn't get an answer either. We decided to pick the lock and there she was in a pool of her own blood. She was passed out. He went to grab some cold water and I tried to wake her. At one point her eyes opened but she wasn't responding to anything. Her eyes then rolled in the back of her head. We poured water on her, tried to give her some water to drink, and slapped her face some. She wasn't waking up. So the roommate called 911. She finally woke up crying and was upset we called. They came in asked her questions and went to the psych ward. That was one of the hardest things I've ever seen. Seeing someone I care about on the ground in a pool of blood unresponsive. Well I went home. Sat in the shower until the water got cold. Then laid in my bed crying for an hour or so. I finally stopped and just stared up at the ceiling until around noon. She texted me saying they let her out. She was better. She said her blood alcohol level was over double the legal limit. We talked for a few moments then she went to sleep. I still couldn't sleep so I went to a bar with a friend had a beer and a burger. Went over to his place and watched a movie. She texted me again around 8 or 9 and we talked until I finally took some sleeping medicine and fell asleep till about 10 the next morning. Sunday I spent most day soar. My joints where throbbing and my body aching. I slept most of the day on the couch. We started to text again around 8 at night. We talked about what happened. We decided to go bowling with her family this week. Then the topic about what happened in bed came up. She said she was sorry and it felt like kissing a brother. She knows how I feel about her. Well when we where in the bed talking she said I never asked her on a date. So I asked her. I said was that just drunk talk or did she mean it. She said we could hang out but she didn't want me to think it was a date. This really hurt. I told her goodnight right after that. I stayed up crying a bit. I felt owed you know? I know I'm not owed anything. I just felt so alone after that. I tried texting a few people to see if they would talk and I told one person my problem and they responded with I don't know how to respond to that. I finally wanted just to end it. I though about hanging myself. I had some belts I know could do the job. I then thought about all the pills I had. I could take all of my prescription pills and a bunch of Advil and pain killers. I thought about the big bottle of Benadryl I have. I know if I would take all of those something would happen.  I live alone. No one would find me till I didn't show up to work today. And still then it would be a no call no show. I know I could do it. I feel like one of the only reasons I didn't was because I was to tired to get up. My joints where in to much pain. Or maybe that's just what I tell myself. Maybe I actually want to live. I don't know. But now that I'm at work this morning I'm still not against the idea. I'm just tired of being alone. I have been ""friend zoned"" or ""like a brother to me"" way to many times. The others that have said that I've understood. But this girl is different. I've had a crush on her since I was in 6th grade. I'm just tired of the disappointment my life has come. I thought I would have started a family now. My stupid fucking disease has made me fat. Hurts my joints when I work out. I cant stop fucking eating fast food because it fills a hole temporarily. I don't know what I'm looking for posting here. I know I have rambled a lot I mostly just wanted to tell someone how I feel. I just want someone to talk to. I just want to feel happy again. I want to put this fake smile away and have a real one.

I am not a super religious person but to me it seems that God works in mysterious ways. I know this is cliche but I do actually believe it. Shitty things happen, and while you may not know why yet, there is a reason for them. Like the saying goes, when one door closes, another one opens. I'm sorry your family looks at you as a disappointment, that's very crappy of them and I can only imagine how upset that must make you. You are full of potential though. Do you attend school or work? Being 19, you have a whole bunch of opportunities at your fingertips. You are young enough for it to be okay if you don't have your whole life figured out yet. Do some thinking about what interests you, and where you would like to be in 5 years. Make short-term goals that may help you fulfill a long term goal you have been thinking about. This will make the task seem way more manageable. Also, just give your girlfriend some time. I'm not sure what happened obviously, but she may just need to cool down before she is ready to talk again. If she doesn't end up wanting to talk, then honestly, screw her. My last ex boyfriend literally just stopped talking to me, and that's how he broke up with me. We were long distance also so I had absolutely no way of communicating with him. I was so hurt. He went on and on saying how much he cared/loved me, yet he can't even give me the time of day to respond to a text. After awhile though I realized it was his loss. If he can't even be mature enough to respond, and have the respect for me to give me some sort of answer, then fuck him. I deserve better and so do you. Break-ups suck, but (here comes another cliche), time heals all wounds. It has taken awhile for me but I am finally able to smile and not think about him all day. I know this will happen for you too.

she's too young to be in daycare. social services told me if i had to put her in daycare daily they'd move her to another home. it's so that she can form a strong bond with me and not get screwed up developmentally, but they didn't tell me this until after i took her in so i wasn't really prepared for it. i will be honest if i had known it would have factored in heavily to the decision making process.

and everyone who comes in contact with her one on one has to be background checked. those take 3-6 weeks. and if i wanted to leave her with my mother-in-law then social services has to do a home study there too (another 3-6 weeks).

that's what makes it so stressful. if this were my kid, i wouldn't have to have a panel of workers and lawyers weigh in on whether i could put her in daycare, or go on vacation, or have my mother-in-law help me out. until background checks come back i'm stuck.

I am big also, 24 never dated, come really close to finding a hooker just to not be a virgin but couldn't even force my-self to take that chance. I have awful friends from high school that are the only ones who still remotely stay in contact. And the only things I regret are not taking chances because I thought it would affect me down the road or disappoint my parents. Although I did have a occurrence. I did have a family situation like you but that was when I was younger. I didn't know better and I wouldn't do it now so I don't beat my-self up about it.    

I had several chances. I am the nice guy and people would ask to hang out go out but I never did because I thought I would screw up and never have the chance again. With girls I thought I would somehow disrespect them so even though I am confident enough around them I would never take the next step even when begged to. I wish I would have went out and done some messed up shit and taken some chances. I have no stories to tell when I get older. At least you have friends that you routinely hang out with even if they don't give you gifts. 

After coming out of my shell in college and finding real friends after three years in, they are all still in the college town and I had to move away to find a job. We don't talk as much as we used to. And I haven't met one new person in my new city. This is because I don't want to do anything I will regret. It confines me. The only thing from not making a post on this sub my-self is I believe everything will work out. I will eventually meet someone. I will find friends. You've got to push your-self to believe that. 

This was a little therapeutic for me also so thanks. I think I'll start going to some local bars and strike up some conversations and try to get out there a little more.

I have my last appointment tomorrow with my crappy psychiatrist that we've already filed a complaint with. My dad is coming with me. Even though I'm 21, I'm severely mentally ill and live at home with no job or school anymore and I am under their insurance. I called the CSB down the street earlier for advice on how to go about getting admitted and the lady on call was extremely rude, saying that if I haven't made an active attempt, I can't be considered for our city's inpatient programs (which isn't true, I've been inpatient several times). I do not have access to money, a car, or even any friends with cars who could assist in taking me to the ER. My parents have dealt with my illnesses for years and I'm grossly undermedicated and poorly treated with the disorders I have. I was taken off of several medications including a strong antipsychotic in January and a prescribed, non-abused benzo and a mood stabilizer in February, and things have been all downhill from there. I'm marked down as a drug abuser with manipulative behavior. I've been thinking and wanting to commit suicide since the day after I left the hospital in March for the fourth time. I attempted three days later but was never taken in and everyone talks about it being a ""stunt"". Thankfully my therapist is great, so I'm calling her in the morning to see if she can't talk some sense into my parents and make them take me into the ER, which they have said several times they will not do anymore. I've packed a bag and gotten numbers together for my proposed trip to the psych ward for a few weeks. I've been there, my old psychiatrist works there still and he's great but my parents hate him for medicating me. Anyways, I'm at the end of my rope. I have two options. Do everything I can to get my parents to take me in and, for christ's sake, let me get the help I need without injecting their horribly ignorant and ill-informed opinions. I have a note written up and a fool-proof plan. I don't want to do it. The voices want me to. I have to. That's my purpose. Nobody, including my parents, my psychiatrist, and the community services board that I called tonight believes that I could really be that bad off. I started cutting again the other day and was screamed at for it, and persuaded to start smoking again instead of cutting. My parents believe that I do not want to actively get better and I am wasting valuable time and money that could be better spent on other things. Oh and to top it off, I was supposed to move across the country this week to live with my ex who was going to provide a stable home for me away from my parents. I fucked that up. I fuck everything up. I'm fucked up. I am trapped. And I will either fight my way out of this hole, or I will kill myself in it. There is no third option.

I am so sorry you are going through this. I am 18, and a freshman at uni. I understand the overwhelming feeling of being around strangers and feeling excluded, but most people are usually nice and are willing to talk as long as you open up. I understand feeling self-conscious too, but I find that most people judge themselves much more harshly than others. Most people have body struggles during their life, even some of the most gorgeous girls I know have struggled with their body image.

Does your college have a counselling center? If so, I would strongly recommend it. **Reach out** Get help, Talk to a doctor. They can help you. You can recover. We are much stronger than we feel. 

As far as weight goes..Why not use that s a way to be social? Is there a running club or some work of workout club at your school? Your self-worth is not measured by your appearance, or by the number on the scale. It's measured by your morality, and any decent person will agree.

I do not take it for given that, in all cases, suicide won't help the people around them more than it hurts. It will help the people that they are burdening.

EDIT: I guess I should explain what I mean by ""it would delight the people that hate them"" since a lot of people are fixating on that.

I've noticed that suicide victims often make a lot of friends post-mortem. Suddenly people that previously didn't like them and had negative impacts on their life are now their friends, and the people that were actually their friend are now all their best friends. People think it is cool to have a friend who committed suicide. It gives them a tragic aura that chicks dig or something. I'm not expecting anyone to literally jump for joy at my death, but people that do not like me will definitely use my death to forward their own goals. Of that I am sure. Honestly, I don't mind.

Anyways, I panicked and called my ex-boyfriend since I didn't pass out in the next ten minutes, and then ended up for physical treatment in the hospital for 3 days (charcoal + liver enzyme solutions, bloodwork, etc), then in the psych ward for several days after that. He didn't bother calling my parents to find out what was wrong with me because he 'didn't want to cause conflict', aka he was afraid of them and didn't want them to get mad at him-so I just cried for days and days when I wasn't sleeping or throwing up that he wasn't there. I struggle so much day-to-day with emotion, I feel either empty or so intensely full of rage or love or sadness that it becomes overwhelming and I have very little control over it (I have borderline personality disorder). Plus my past and present weren't exactly low-stress.
My ex won't talk to me right now, which I agree is probably good since I'm going through treatment for my borderline, but I was frustrated for several days and I couldn't figure out why. Then it dawned on me that it wasn't that he had set that boundary, I get why he set it, he's obviously hurt and afraid and frustrated and walking on eggshells with me, but he set it in a slightly aggressive way and made it so uncertain that he'd talk to me after. I get really upset that I can never communicate effectively what I feel without reiterating the same conversations where it goes to x,y blame gaming or giving an explanation for why my emotions change as they do. His response always when I have been in crisis is to play 'hero' when things are bad, but then completely abandon me when things get very very bad.
And I get that he can't be a support system because that's hard on him, but it just feels so unfair that I don't have a single friend who actually cares enough to put their own feelings of anger aside and just..talk I guess. I didn't do it for attention, and I feel enough shame and fear about it, but I am trying the best I can to do better and it's really hard when him and my only other good friend won't talk to me (or in the case of this other friend, she just talks about her own problems and minimizes mine, because I'm in that sort of caretaking role. In every goddamn friendship ever).
I just wish I could talk to him so badly and explain that it wasn't his fault or anything, that it was nobody's fault but mine because I can't handle emotion properly, it's either so intense or so absent, but I can't because I would violate that communication boundary he set (that he won't talk to me for a month).

Diagnosed throughout life with anxiety disorder, depression, aspergers syndrome and ADD, though the last one I lied about to get a double prescription of study drugs. I don't believe aspergers exists, its a fucking excuse for those who have never had to work hard on developing social skills. With the number of things I am diagnosed with, plus the alcolol and trees, I could start a fucking pharmacy.

On some Ambien right now. Don't have enough to OD. I did the math. Do have enough when combined with alcohol for a cry for help. Not even sure what help I need.

Plan out goals, dreams, aspirations, ideas, things you want to do to great a big plan for your life that has personal meaning (which will hopefully encourage you to live to experience everything you want).",,0.0,,2014-11-23 07:45:04,,,0,False,,,,0,,cmaht3e,,,,,t3_2n5cyj,,,t1_cmaht3e,,,,t3_2n5cyj,,,,,,,,1425885394.0,,1,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,1,,

After a good bit of research, I realized that anxiety in itself is not what's bad for you. Anxiety is what helps you be ordered, helps you to be successful.  What you are dealing with is overactive anxiety.  The good news is, there are many avenues to help with this! 
I can post a few article links for you to read, if you wish.  
What i will say is I am extremely proud of you.  It takes a great deal of strength to wade through anxiety.  Find some coping mechanisms that work for you and you will slowly be able to relax when adding small amounts of stress into your life.  It will only get better from there.  Eventually, you will learn to take the over-thinking and the fear and harness it to your will.  You will become successful and you will accomplish things that now seem laughably impossible.

It starts way back in my early days (10-14), after I left the home country and come to the US I found myself in an alien world. I was having the greatest time of my life just before leaving and when I got here it was all gone, there was nothing I liked and no one I knew. When I went to school I landed in ESL, being almost clueless in English I stuck with the people who spoke the language I knew but they were not good people. Soon after that I had no choice but to associate myself with them and slowly through drinking a lot turned into one of them, stupid kids full of hate and now I was one of them. Years went by and after I was taken out into middle of nowhere and over some bullshit had a gun pointed to the back of my head by two of what I thought were my friends, I knew that it was time for me to once again leave everything behind. As soon as I got here I got really depressed, it got somewhat better when I got involved with the people in school but then again I had to leave them behind and depression kicked in again with much force than before. What didn't help at all was that my parents split up around the same time. I was in a cold and dark place for years, no contact with anyone except my family. Somehow I survived that time and got a little better, slowly I built up the courage to try again and meet new people. For a while things seemed to get better for me but just like with the first people I meet here, these new people were not the greatest either and again a downhill path was started. Not wanting to be all alone in a dark and cold place I chose to stick with them and as time went by started doing some drugs, for a while it felt like its helping me to cope with the reality as it is with drugs but before I got too far into the habits I kicked the hard drugs and along with them the people who did them. Here I was again getting into depression for the third time, this time it was a little easier to cope with through occasional smoking of cannabis. I did fall into depression but not as deep as with the two previous times, probably thanks to smoking or having a little experience with depression at this point. I had lost everything I had twice, lost everyone I knew twice and through the experience I gained from that I did not completely sever the ties with all the people I knew. I did end up spending most of the time alone but from time to time I was hanging out , smoking cannabis with 2-3 people from the last pack. This went on for some time and again things seemed to get better. I got really close to my brother in this time since we both smoked and for the most part enjoyed the same things. Years when by and from the initial 2-3 people that I kept in contact with I meet new people and everything seemed to be going well until I realized that my brother is doing drugs. I tried talking with him and tried many different ways to make him stop cause I knew these things don't do much other than numb the mind and close the eyes to reality. I was the only one in the family that knew about this and for a while I really tried many different things that I thought could make him stop but nothing worked and we slowly started to drift away from each other cause he was lying about his drug use. I still thought of him as of my best friend but things were not the same, he started to hide his habits and lie about it a lot but I knew how to spot the signs of these things so I knew he was not being honest with me. He slowed down to the point where I did not pay as much attention to it and time just went by. One day browsing reddit I noticed a post that seemed like its written by my brother and it was a suicide AMA/letter, something wasn't right about it though and the details given out by him were not 100% right. I was almost sure that its him cause of the writing style but he details he was giving out did not match up with reality so I showed it to my sister and she said its probably not him. I hoped she was right but I couldn't sleep at night knowing that I might lose him, I hard a very hard time falling asleep in this time and even the slightest sound around the house would wake me up with thoughts of him doing the unthinkable. It really bothered me but it might have been a false alarm like my sister said so slowly I adjusted back to normal and started sleeping again. Some time ago I meet a girl online, started talking with her and soon I fell head over heels for her but in retrospect way too soon. I really enjoyed talking with her and she seemed to enjoy talking with me, things went really great for me at this time and probably the best since the time I left the home country. I found the motivation to do things and enjoyed life thanks to her lovely personality, I was really happy for the first time in a very long time. I was so happy to find her and finally thought that again I'll be able to enjoy and share life with someone, I kind of sidelined my friends and family a bit for her and I guess I was blinded by love. One thing that I have learned over the years is that things in my life always turn to shit at some point. I noticed that my brother is again abusing drugs so I decided that something has to be done about it and its gotta be done now. I didn't explain it to her but after being so close to my brother through tough time I knew that he needs my help and at this time I sidelined her so I can do something about his issues. There was very little or nothing to be honest that worked first time I noticed he is doing drugs, I tried to get my brother to stop taking the pills but soon I found out that I'm powerless and cant do it just like I wasn't able to do it the first time. Not paying attention to the fact that because I didn't explain whats going on I hurt the feelings of the girl that made me happy and I lost her trust in me. We briefly stopped talking and drifted apart from each other. I didn't want to do it but I decided that since I wasn't able to do anything with my brother I'll let him do what the fuck ever he wants do since hes older than me and should be more responsible. So I tried talking with her but things were not the same, I hurt her feelings and she didn't trust me or was interested in me as much or even at all to be honest. It really hurt my feelings too since I did not intend to cause pain to anyone but that's unfortunately what I did. Depression sets in again at this time, harder and deeper than ever before. I would spend most of the time in my bed not moving and not doing anything except looking at the ceiling, I would spend 20+ hours like that on some days.  I decided I'm not going to let depression eat away at me again so I started self improving myself, I quit smoking cannabis and drinking soon after I stopped smoking cigarettes. I smoked cigarettes for close to 10 years but I had enough will power left in me to kick that habit, it was likely one of the hardest things that I have ever accomplished in my life. It left me with a feeling of achieving something positive and  I thought if I was able to do this maybe I'll be able to something else that's probably very hard, earn the trust of the girl I was so happy to find. That was something that's beyond my control unfortunately, she is not going to give me a chance at redemption. So through this I lost everything that made me happier than I was in a long long time, found hatred for my brother, hate for myself that I let things go this way and general despair about my future. I don't think I can continue living this way, every time that I find the strength and will to get up I just fall down harder and lower. Its getting really hard to find motivation to continue this senseless existence, I only see one solution and way out of this. I am aware it is a cowardly thing to do but it will be a piece of peace that will stay with me, a place where I cant fall down anymore. I had thoughts of hurting people and they seem to have a place in my head now, I do not want to do it that's for sure but I have these flash thoughts that race through my mind and I find it very hard to control them as the days go by. To top it all off I cant afford any therapy or medication since at the moment I am uninsured and underemployed, my family is getting strangled with debt (although they don't want to admit it) as is so I am not going to ask them for help either. I stood on a stool with a belt around my neck twice already and I don't think I can go that way but I already found a very peaceful way to go. For now I'm still fighting this, trying to fight it and not giving up for as long as I can but its getting really hard.. This is just a part of how fucked up I am and how much I messed up my life and lately messing up the life's of people, the things I said here are something that I never spoke about with anyone and I left out a lot of mistakes that I've made in my life since I do not want to be identified and stopped if I decide its time for me to go.

I tick almost every single box.

However, i've never met anyone else with this problem, and i can't find anything on reddit about it either, except for a few passing references. So someone i've cornered into listening to me suggested i post about it.

I have many different issues, so it's hard to know where one ends and another begins, but this seems like one of the biggest. I feel utterly helpless to make decisions about my life without someone else to guide me or care for me. I can usually accomplish very low-risk and low-pressure things — like posting on the Internet — on my own, but anything more than that, even if it's seemingly simple, is tremendously difficult for me.

My mind is constantly occupied with thoughts of my being alone. This year i've lost my only remaining serious real-life friend (almost entirely as a result of my over-dependence, which i understand is very tiring for others), and have almost no relationship with my family, so this fear has recently become a reality. Every day it gets harder and harder for me to accomplish even basic things. Lately i can only do what i feel forced into by circumstance or habit, like going to work. Anything that is more optional or less regular than that — even things like going to the grocery store — has become impossible for me.

I have no ambition of any kind (no serious financial, educational, occupational, or family desires), no real goals in life except to surround myself with people who care about me that i can rely on. And since i have no desire or ability to carry on by myself, my thoughts frequently turn to suicide (as they have for many years) — but my inability to act or make decisions on my own makes me fearful of actually following through. Any other motivation i might have is suppressed by one or more of my other issues — depression, OCD, anxiety, and body-image problems.

Maybe the worst part about it is that i just don't have the words to make anyone else understand it. I have tried to explain it to the few people i have left in my life, and they get the depression and anxiety aspects, but they can't grasp this overwhelming feeling of powerlessness i have when it comes to doing things on my own. I think that they see it as the same sort of helplessness that people often feel when they have depression, but i've experienced both and i know the difference. With enough pep-talking i can usually be motivated to do things when it's just depression, but this is something else. It's not the same at all.

Short of a new best friend falling out of the sky i can't think of a way to solve this before it becomes completely unbearable. There's nobody near me who can fill the role i need filled, nobody i've met who can even relate to it.

The older I get the longer and more intense the periods of depression are. 

This year has been the hardest. This is the first year I've stayed at home with my first son. It's hard not to dwell on everything. Difficult not to obsess about everything wrong. I have to force myself to think about the positives. Force myself to move around even 30 minutes a day. I've recently realized how much I've let myself physically deteriorate. Walking has become a chore. I'm completely unmotivated, and it's even affected my social communication. In the real world, talking to people one on one, I go completely blank. Can't think of anything to say, and when I do it comes out jumbled and incoherent. I've essentially given up on trying to talk to anyone at all because it becomes an agonizingly stressful for me. I find myself literally not caring, not having opinions on anything, and just ""floating"" in this haze that has become my waking day. 

I want so desperately to get healthy and motivated. I loathe myself for letting my son see me like this. I hate how  this is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend. I've been trying to reach out for help, but everywhere I look I come to dead ends or EXPENSIVE solutions. Every psychiatrist in my area charges $300 a session, every counseling place has lost their doctors, and every hospital/clinic only refers you to those counseling places. I try to talk to my boyfriend about things, but he's just not *that* type of guy. My attempts to exercise are fruitless because I'm so unmotivated. 

I'm just lost. Completely and utterly lost, confused, hurt, and feel betrayed and so incredibly angry because I have no where to turn for support. 

I've never been one to even consider suicide, but I caught myself empathizing with people who are. How comforting and certain those last moments must be. To KNOW that the fight is coming to an end. To feel that hug of death. That certainty that lives of loved ones will go on, and that your suffering will end. 

For me, those thoughts are terrifying. I keep pushing myself forward for my son, but I can't help but wonder how long I can keep this up. How long until I lose myself completely.

24799,,True,[deleted],,,,"I'll say first of all that I was quite entertained by what you've written down. I really hope that this isn't offensive; you're just a good writer. It felt like I was reading a draft for the sequel of Catcher in the Rye. You should consider writing more.

What does the world mean? I've had similar questions, broke down because of it too. What happens to us? Is this all? Man, these are big questions. I can't answer them. 

What I do know though is that, we are a bit more than our pure objective reasoning can explain. I'm a humanist like that. I believe that we're a bunch of chemicals, sure, that's good enough. But, if reasoning of our purpose leads us to believe that we are just here to be useless, pleasure obtaining, pain avoiding beings, who are bound to the purpose of sleeping, eating, and fucking, then I don't believe that. 

I believe that we are here to inspire, to help, to learn, and to direct our lives in directions diverse from those who have lived before us, and will live after us. That we are meant to just sleep? D'uh. I love taking naps and sleeping in, it's awesome. That we have to eat all the time? So what? I love satisfying those pangs of hunger with a burger, or some foreign piece of cuisine. It's also awesome. About being here just to fuck and reproduce? There are people who don't want to fuck at all. There are people who love to fuck just for the pleasure of it. At least in that instance, we can avoid the predetermined order of the universe and choose what we want to do.

I'm not sure I'm making sense here. And I know that you never mentioned any of the things I just mentioned. But, to me, it does sound like you're kind of getting bored with your existence. You've experienced those emotions before, and now you're going to experience them again. Woop-dee-doo. Get me out of here. Sure.

But just take a wait. Do something completely outrageous. Quit your degree. Fuck it. The universe will always be there, it can wait until you want to study it, since someday you will no longer be here. In that way, the universe is kind of boring. It's always there. Why can't it just fuck off for a while? It doesn't even know what it'll do for its future- lame. You can though. You can quit your degree, randomly go in bars and hit on chicks- then laugh about your constant rejections after. You can buy a game system, and practice your trigger finger until you're at the top of the CoD:Black Ops tournament boards. I don't know. If that sounds too hedonistic for you, do something else. Write a book- even if you only write a sentence a day. Work out, save your money, and hike that trail that spans 2000 miles by yourself. You don't have to do any of these, but it's your choice. Just be happy with what you choose.

As for God. I believe in him. I was a catholic until I discovered that he made no sense. It's not that I lost my faith in God, it's just that I've lost faith in the men that spread him. You'll find that many people of the past felt the same way. Milton, the writer of Paradise Lost, was a puritan who believed that God came to man, or man came to God, in a very intimate and specialized manner. Kierkegaard, an existential philosopher, believed that it was better to be a good atheist than a bad Christian. He believed that God came to people in a special way too; in a way that is different than what the church stated (but in a way that I forgot and cannot specify on, haha). I don't know. You can believe in God but think he's not there. Why is that so strange? I don't think it's strange. I abandoned the Catholic faith and I still look up to the words of Jesus, and different passages of the Bible. They give me strength. Maybe its source may be man rather than God, but they're still full of warmth, and that warmth helps me get through a lot of rough days.

Your psychotic event sounds pretty bad. I wish I could help, but our brains are a bit of a fucker. I have thoughts in my head that tell me to kill myself whenever I'm happy. No, not unhappy: happy. I try to tell it to stop, but I guess it'll just say that to me for a while until I convince it otherwise. Fight hard my friend- look to the bible. You don't need to look up to God, but the Bible really does help those weary spiritual legs! And if you don't look to the bible, look a friend, or an idol, or something. I mentioned Milton and Kierkegaard earlier because those two are my personal heroes. They've influenced me to keep on trying. Maybe I don't have a purpose, but fuck it, I'll at least try to find/make one for myself.

Huh . . .

Yeah- what else can I say. Not much really. I really think you'll be fine- you just need to relax. Sartre, another hero of mine, once stated that life becomes just as scary when we realize we can do almost anything we chose. Get a job at a burger stand, rent your own apartment. Personally, I try to wash dishes as fast as I can, and plan on writing a small book on the art of dish washing. Boring as fuck, sure, but whatever. I don't know . . . Point is, I have learned that the universe is boring. The only thing that has ever made it interesting has been the people who create new meanings for these boring things that the world has given us. 

Also, tone it down on the pot smoking and the binge drinking dude. You're going to need your liver and your lungs for those things you might want to do in the future :)

Take care of yourself. 
I believe and hope that you'll be fine.

I would advise thinking about it for longer; considering your motives, and whether in light of them it really is the right thing. It sounds like you're especially concerned with life at home: if this *is* a major concern, I would advise you to at least wait a few years. University can be very difficult, but its important to know that it really is a temporary thing (at least, far more temporary than the rest). And if you feel you really can't see it through, try speaking to a support officer? Most schools have procedures that allow their students to take one or more years out for personal reasons - you could defer the course and try something completely different, perhaps in another country, away from your home situation (after all, your english is good!).
In any case I would advise against the train idea. It might seem tempting, but it is very public, and having seen the aftermath personally, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

This started 2 years ago. First year of university, I was a decent student in high school but something just didn't click here. I failed lots of my classes just because for some reason I did not care. I ended up needing to transfer to a different program to stay in the same school and was under ""probation"".

2nd year again I fail some classes and get met with a ""do not continue"" for the next year. I try to play it off but it still kills me inside. I decide to fake taking off the next year to all my friends and family (except parents). 

During this fake year I take 2 online courses and work full time. One of the courses I do very well in but the 2nd one is what just brought me lower in my own guilt. I manage to get a 66 in this course when I need a 70 or higher to get back into my university (reinstatement). Even though this is not guaranteed I tried my hardest to get this grade but in the end I was not prepared for the work from the course and a full time job. 

I am now thinking about just ending my life and making this easy. All the way my parents have been wondering where they went wrong and I kept telling them I would be fine the next year. Each time I kept telling them and they would believe me and hope the best for the future. I am now at a point where I would get rejected going back to school and I can't go back to work. I can't even face my parents right now. I should just kill myself and make this easy for everyone.

I have lied to almost everyone I know about my university and now I can't even make it up. These past few years have been fucking hell on me and now I lost my last chance to fix it. I had 3 fucking chances and I blew it. Why should I continue to live. I am not worth living anymore.

Sorry mom and dad.

Forgot to add. I have since tried to beg the teacher to raise my mark to the 70 to fit but its a lost cause. I did 70+ in all the assignments and the exams but the participation really killed my grade. I didn't feel very comfortable interacting with them on the message board but was forced to for my grade. ""Don't be shy"" is what he said...I tried to ask him to revalue some of the assignments and exams but he believes on fair grading. This is a big reason why I think this is finally over.

If i end up in a situation like yours I will probably not throw everything i have to deal with this situation. I will try to land back at home, meet up with old friends and share with them my difficulties, talk to a psychiatrist to get me on antidepressants that work for me, explore my hobbies and interests a little more and start enjoying day to day life. It will take a while to find that happens again but i believe that it is the best thing for anyone.

You seem to have worked hard and sacrificed a lot, you have done everything in your power to be with your daughter. I do not consider you a failed man or anything like that. Going back to live your life again is not a weakness. You will probably find a lot of inner happiness again and will start to love life for what it has for you.

If your daughter wants to contact you one her own one day it won't be hard for her to do so. I think she will only feel happy and special when she hears how much you have tried to be with her.

I am on antidepressants that really worked for me and life doesn't feel as demanding and crushing any longer, I am very happy and i have a lot of fun wherever i go today. I think you can find something that works for you too.

lastly, i liked this guys advice, I hope you enjoy it:

I want to start this off by saying I am not particularly suicidal and there is minimum short-term urgency on this.

That being said, I have been struggling through a ton of thoughts and daydreams about dying and I cannot seem to get rid of them. These sort of thoughts range from me killing myself to just different accidental ways I could die. I have had a lot of these thoughts before, but they are of more concern to me know because I feel a strange sense of longing towards them. I just feel really apathetic about myself and I do not think I can make myself get out of bed and be normal for fifty more years (I am 20).

I have a ton of good things in my life and a lot of people I am close to. I do not think I would ever kill myself, because I am really concerned with how that would affect those aroud me. Additionally, as I mentioned before, I am too apathetic about it to DO anything.

I get depressed sometimes, although I question whether it is to a clinical level or not. Last month was super hard for me. However, the thoughts I am concerned with do not come up when I am feeling super emotional or a spiraling pool of self-loathing or anything. They strike mostly when I am not doing much, idle thoughts as I drive and tie my shoes. The thing is, I really want to keep these thoughts from happening when I am really emotional, because I can be a rash individual.

I just want to know if anyone has any ideas where these thoughts are coming from and/or how I can deal with them. The only thing I can think of is that I stopped cutting 112 days ago. For most every day since then I have wanted to. Are these images in my head just an escalation of the pain I want to be feeling? Idk.

11348,,True,[deleted],,,,"I have already commented once asking a question, but I thought of some stuff I wanted to share. First of all, you say that you have been trying to figure out ""HOW TO BE HAPPY"". I think that you should be focusing on ""HOW TO NOT FEEL SO SHITTY THAT YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF"". Try moving into a state of ""NO EMOTION"", or at least ""LACK OF PAIN"", and then go for happiness from there. From my personal experience, I feel like you're missing an important first step.

Emotions can be noxious, man. Thoughts can be noxious, too. 

&gt;nox·ious  (nkshs)
adj.
1. Harmful to living things; injurious to health: noxious chemical wastes.
2. Harmful to the mind or morals; corrupting: noxious ideas.

Read the second definition. I feel like our emotions and thoughts can be just that, noxious, corrupting. I think that if you are cognizant of that fact, then you are less apt to be taken in by them.

On a different note, it seems like you have tried all of the ""traditionally accepted"" forms of feeling better. Have you thought about just lounging and being the man (or woman?)?

For example, I think that it makes me happy to treat myself to nice food (there's a vietnamese and a mexican restaurant near me that I like) almost every day. I consider this to be kind of lazy of me, but the food tastes good, and why would you not treat yourself while you're alive and have the means to do so? The restaurants benefit from the patronage, too.

And I try to talk to the people in my life (co-workers, whoever) about what's going on in my life, and if they are interested in sharing, what's going on in theirs. I think making friends is great for spicing things up in your life.

Honestly though, work on eliminating/leaving-behind the bad. From my experience, that's what will make you feel the best.",,0.0,,2010-01-25 03:21:29,,,0,False,,,,0,,c0jcj51,,,,,t3_atogn,,,t1_c0jcj51,,,,t3_atogn,,,,,,,,1426194068.0,,3,False,,,,,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,,,3,,

Don't buy into the idea that you have to grow up and be an adult. Live your life one day at a time, try to find something that makes you interested right now, if that changes tomorrow, cool, otherwise life would be boring!

Maybe some of this will help you:

The book that turned my life around, not even exaggerating: Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz.

You are a redditor, you should be able to find it online..wink wink ;)

The main thing is CHANGE, everything sucks now, cuz it's the same, you've gotta change something, anything, or everything. It's the only way out.

On another note, exercise is proven to increase the happy chemicals in your brain, just start some sort of light workout routine, walk around the park, do push ups and sit ups.

The other thing that helps me is the realization that no matter how bad it gets, I know things will look up eventually. I have this sort of motto that I've kind of lived by since I was like 16. ""Nothing Lasts"" At first it sounds depressing right?

Well, yea, it might seem that way, but when you really think about it, it's kinda awesome. Nothing good is going to last forever and nothing bad will either. It just means that everything is always changing, and the best way to get out of a bad situation is to change something, anything will do. Your depression won't last as long as you change something!

There are tons of places that offer a first yoga class for free. Even if you've never done it before, it's pretty cool. Or, some colleges offer free classes for anyone.

Also, you should check out some new music, youtube is actually awesome for this very purpose. I find that when I'm feeling down, listening to some death metal gives me a vicarious release and I feel better!

I don't know if there is anyone who is 'truly happy', it's more of a state of mind than anything else. We have to constantly reevaluate and readjust ourselves to the world in order to stay in that state of mind, it's hard and you will fail from time to time, but it will get better, with change.

Also, the standard ""try and find a hobby"" still applies.

I don't know how I'll go out yet, but it's becoming increasingly clear that I'll have to take the second option...

I want to believe that things are okay. I don't really think the United States is as horrible as people say. I've read a lot about it and my grandfather is a history buff so I've always been exposed to the best and worst of history. I used to be so optimistic. 

I want to be an engineer. I want to do research and make a difference. I want to travel and be exposed to new technologies. But the only successful scientists and engineers start out as rich geniuses, neither of which I've ever been. 

And I'm a stupid American. I'm so fucking diluted as a race and I've got the genetic predisposition and geological location that makes me a fucking idiot. I'll never be as good of an engineer as a German or as educated as basically anyone because of our horrible education system. I'm poor, but I've been going to college libraries since I was 11 trying to read up on science and engineering principles and mathematics because I know that I have the disadvantage of being naturally retarded and from a poor, loser background. I've had to uphold myself through autodidactism. 

I was severely abused as a child and I continue to be abused. I don't know how to get out. I don't know how I'll pay for college, but it's my only way out. I started college at 16 through a program but I wont have that money from my school once I graduate officially.

I'm also mental. I've been formally diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and I'm paralyzed whenever things don't work out as punctually as possible. I plan everything. I have calenders and journals and reminders and routines and although I can adhere to them myself, the world wont cooperate and it sends me into a deep depression whenever things aren't right. They're never fucking right. 

I was born retarded in an unjust world and I can no longer be the optimistic futurist I was once. And I don't know my next action. I don't know which direction to take. I'd really rather not die, though. It'd be messy, I know it, and if I somehow managed to survive, it would be more horrible than ever. And the pain and mess my loved ones would be left with would be unimaginable. Even through all of the abuse I've endured myself, I'd never leave anyone with that.  Someone convince me not to die. Convince me to do something else. Give me advice, I don't know.

Other than a therapist ( I don't have one right now), I would never talk to anyone in person about this. I'm the last person anyone would imagine having these sort of problems. But I struggle so much with them. I can't even think of myself the way others think of me. If I thought of myself what others think of me, I'd believe I could accomplish anything. But I know that I can't. And I know that I have no chance in this world because of its nature.

you're struggling with depression at the very least, that's obvious. depression is an insidious, debilitating illness. it's not *you*, though. you're not a coward. getting up and out of bed is an act of supreme bravery when you're depressed. ditto for doing all the little things like brushing your teeth or combing your hair or changing out of pajamas. depression subjects its victims to terrible suffering and it's simply not fucking fair.

please, call a hotline, they'll direct you to services that will help you. *depression is treatable.* it may not be the easiest ailment to treat, and the road to recovery might be long and full of setbacks, but you could easily say the same of anything worth having in this world. there are people out there in the world who are dealing with similar issues, who understand what you're going through. if nothing else please seek a support group. they're free and it can be incredibly comforting to have comrades along for the ride. 

i'm so fucking sorry this is happening to you. mental illness, gosh... hell of a thing for anyone to deal with. but you writing this here is a step in the right direction. give yourself a chance, please, and call a hotline. it's scary as hell, i've had to do the same thing. holding the phone in my hand, dialing, hanging up. just keep dialing. i couldn't stop crying for the first five minutes i was on the phone with someone. like full on out of control sobbing. they waited patiently for me to calm down enough so i could actually talk.

I have been diagnosed with depression for years now (each doctor has their own take: MDD, Bi-bolar, dysthymic.. in chronological order of doctor). Suicide, as many of you probably know, is a fact of life - it maintains its own presence.

I have been hospitalized before. I still have literal nightmares about the place. It was the Army and it was not pleasant.

I am in my late 30's. I am a (peacetime) veteran so I have VA resources and access to medical support, if you can call it that.

I have been under a lot of pressure, or at least I feel pressured and stressed. I am slightly crippled (hence veteran) so that's some stress, but I am trying to get out of the hole of uselessness I have been in by attending college (stress number two, etc).

And now, divorce. In one of her drunken fests she yelled and blamed me for a lot and we agreed to do a trial separation in some time. A couple days later I told her it was going to be a divorce. We are not at each other's throats. We intend to go on being the best friends we were, or as best we can, but a divorce is a divorce. Oddly enough, there is of course emotional stress, but the divorce is probably the silver lining. It could go belly-up and I could end up homeless for a short time, but I believe we can be civil.

A little time before the marital fight I started to struggle. Probably best to place it at about 3 months ago. My 'control' over negative thoughts, at least to maintain healthier thought-practices, began to really slip.

I hate talking about myself and my issues. Not sure why here is fine, but it may change once you guys ask questions - will try to maintain focus, though. I should note that I have no real caring support group, other than by those whose job it is to care (the VA, the crisis line number they ask you to call every 15 mins to cover their own asses). My wife does not believe in about 97% of mental disorders. Bringing up my depression has been taboo, so no support or remaining support there.

I have hated myself in varying degrees and specifics for so long I am not sure it is in anyone's interest to change. (For example: I have always hated looking at myself and have finally gotten quasi-permission from my wife to cover the mirror, if that were to change I wold be very much a different person). The hatred is mutual, though. No woman has wanted to get close to me for years.

So, I guess what I am asking is, what is the point? How can I, you, anyone, live each day like this? Why would you want to?

I am searching for why I fight for life so much but come up empty.

I'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons and I hope it isn't inappropriate to post in this sub, but I'm just not sure where else to go. It may be insensitive and I definitely apologize ahead of time, but I feel that talking to someone who has lived through an attempt or dealt with someone close attempting, will help me understand what the fuck is going on. I'll try and summarize as best as I can, but any kind words or support or opinions or thoughts would be much appreciated. 

To preface, I am not suicidal however in lieu of recent events I realized that I may have some mental health issues of my own which I will need to deal with. I have been seeing a counselor infrequently for the past few years but I will be making more of an effort to have regular sessions.

Okay, so let's get to it. My mother attempted suicide on Wednesday. Although the topic of suicide and depression and mental health is a regular topic in my family (mostly in an informal or sarcastic way) we never expected this to actually happen. For as long as I can remember my mom, as well as a few other people in my family, have made side comments about hating life, or talking about life insurance with suicide clauses, or going through what we call seasonal depression. But the context of the comments really raised no red flags. I thought that people who actually follow through with it were the ones that never talk about it. It was seemingly normal in my family. We are not emotional or outwardly compassionate. I would describe us as having very pragmatic and clinical reactions to most things. If something happens, you deal with it. You don't breakdown. You don't talk about it. You just get through it and move on. I realize now we were all very wrong and should not have been making these comments, but it was really just the norm. My mom never had a serious tone and never made anything seem like a cry for help. She would go through periods where she wouldn't leave the house or avoid talking to people, but she's been the exact same way for 40 years. Nothing obvious seemed to change. 

Then this happened. She took a large amount of pills and tried to go to sleep. Her body reacted appropriately and she got violently ill. My dad (her spouse of 40 years) found her on the bedroom floor and called an ambulance. She is known to take naps quite often or go to sleep early because of headaches, so her being in bed at 6pm wasn't uncommon. My dad said later the night of, that if she was in her bed and not on the floor, he wouldn't have thought anything was wrong. He would have let her sleep. There was nothing out of the ordinary. 

I've learned this is a normal initial reaction, but she's making it very clear she hates my dad for keeping her alive. She wanted him to leave her there. She joked about it for years - she didn't want to be resuscitated. We were to leave her until there were no vitals. That was her request, but it was always said as a side comment. But my dad did what he thought was best and I'm glad he did. 

She allowed me to see her the next morning in the hospital because she needed her glasses and some things from home. As soon as I brought them in, she called security to escort me out. I broke down crying (which because of our demeanor, I never do) and she let me stay. I stayed for a few hours and let her talk. I said very little but I wanted to keep the conversation normal. I didn't want to pity her or talk about what happened, I just wanted to keep her occupied. I thought that was the right thing to do. It seemed to help because she was making jokes and I convinced her to eat some toast. And she opened up to me more than she ever has before. So we talked how we would in any other circumstance. Apparently it wasn't because the nurse told my mom it was in my best interest to leave because my comments were too negative. The nurse said our conversation indicated that I have similar issues and I will not help anything and I need to see a doctor myself. So my mom agreed and called security and I was escorted out. 

My emotions got to me in the moment and I just kept saying ""you don't know her."" ""She's my mother. You met her 12 hours ago."" She doesn't trust doctors, she never has and that passed along to me and it was very hard to understand why she would choose them over her family. I realize now that her family hasn't helped anything up to this point, and these people are professionals. We need them. They know what they're doing. So I really regret that the time I got to spend with her, I did exactly the opposite of what I should have done. I was the only one that got to visit and I fucked it up. 

After that, she requested no visitors and made all of her information confidential. If we call or try to visit, they deny that she's even a patient. So we know nothing. No one has had any contact since I was kicked out. Nothing. Not a word. We have to wait until she's ready to see or talk to us. All we know is that she will be there for the 72 hour hold and can leave at the doctor's discretion. They are not required to tell us anything, so we don't know if she has to be released to someone's care or if she will be able to call a cab and go home. We have no idea. 

I think most of the reason for posting this was to get it out, which also explains the wall of text. I wanted to tell people who don't know me. Who don't know my family. Because the future is 100% unknown, the waiting is driving me nuts. My mind won't stop racing and I'm just trying to wrap my head around an outcome that is impossible to predict. We don't know what to expect or how to react when we can see her or when she comes home and it's very hard to deal with. We are all very scared.

If anyone is willing to take the time to read this and try and understand my point of view and pass along anything helpful, I will be surprised, but also very grateful. 

Stay strong everyone. I know that the world for me and my family just turned upside down and this event will definitely change my outlook on life and family and love and friendship and everything else that I've always taken for granted, that I've always joked about. I hate that it took something as serious and heartbreaking as this to make me realize it and I hope my mom hasn't given up.",False,SuicideWatch,t5_2qpzs,self,Aftermath of Mother's Attempt,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/362ebg/aftermath_of_mothers_attempt/,

I'm asking because I've been there and the only thing that dragged me out of depression (besides friends such as yourself) kicking and screaming was having a job that forced me to get up, fake caring, and interact with people.  

A part of my depression was that I had given up on myself, and from the limited context it sounds like he has given up on himself as well.  You might be able to help out by trying to give him some confidence in small ways with compliments, praise, and thank you's.

27346,,True,TheMoniker,,,,"I went through a similar situation a while ago, my father died, my girlfriend, whom I was madly in love with, turned on me (spreading vicious rumours and treating me terribly), my friends ended up buying the rumours and so I ended up losing most of my friendships then as well (though I've mended a few in the time since). I was heartbroken, grieving and alone. I just want you to know that, yes, these things are ridiculously rough and, yes, it's one hell of a struggle to get through it  but if you do hold on, it is essentially certain to get better. If you just hunker down and push through this, you will find a strength in yourself that you might not have known you had, you will find love again and other friends who aren't dirt bags. Regarding your ex and your friend, there will be a time when you will be surrounded by other friends, with someone else in your arms whom you will care for just as much as, if not much more than, you cared for your ex and you will have basically forgotten about those people who screwed you over. In fact, you might even find yourself offering comfort to someone else going through a similar situation to what you went through, assuring them that it will get better. Also, I'm guessing that, since your grandfather cared for you a great deal, he would have wanted you to get through this and to hold out until you find joy and happiness in your life again.

I'm 13 year old girl. I know that sounds ridiculous, but I am. I also know that my problems aren't as big as other's, but they are to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was a really good child. I was smart, happy, and I loved doing just about anything, as long as I was with my family. That was when I was 4. I remember my parent's loving each other so much. At least, that's what I thought. My mother ran away with my step-sister's father without a single word, taking all of our money. She was having an affair. I was forced to live with my father from then on.

When I was 7, he started to throw things at me and scream and yell. I would cry in the corner and he'd just keep saying such horrible things to me, I had no idea why. I hadn't done anything to hurt him. I skipped a grade, I had good friends, I was a good kid. He'd continuously 'forget' to feed me for days, leaving me in my room for hours to do nothing. It was empty in there, besides my bed and my box TV, which I would watch to cheer myself up.
I started to fail in my classes, I skipped school and sat at the baseball field for hours and pretend that I was there. All of my friends left me, rumors spread about me, and everyone hated me.

Just this morning I landed on my foot wrong when I fell down the stairs. I started screamed and sobbed, and he just stood over me, playing on his tablet, and said: ""I told you so."", because I get excited easily and tend to jump around a lot. He won't take me to the doctor's. I think It's sprained, I can't do anything with it, it hurts too much.
Yesterday I was talking to him calmly, and he disagreed with me and threw his cigarettes at me, screaming and telling me to go kill myself.
On Christmas, when my family left, he told me I was a worthless piece of shit that needs to die. I suppose I could agree. I mean, if someone goes out of their way to scream at me, to throw chairs at me, to make me want to kill myself - how could I be worth anything at all?
He used all of my college savings on cigarettes. He used all of my money to buy things for himself. I was going to use that to fly to the only place I want to travel to. Now I have to start all over. I had thousands in there, It's all gone. There's nothing.

I tried to talk to my grandma, the only person I trust, and she didn't believe me. She said that he was such a good person. Can you believe it? 
My counselor said I was overreacting and sent me to detention for a week after hours.
I called the police and they said that if I ever called again for false reasons they'd lock me up.
It's funny, how all of the people that you're supposed to trust hate me. Everyone hates me now. My family doesn't like me. My school doesn't like me. Fuck, even my own parent's don't like me. I don't understand what I've done wrong. He sliced down my arm with scissors before. Yet, I'm too much of a coward to call anyone and say anything. I barely even speak anymore. He's thrown chairs and stools at me before. He broke my TV that I've used for so long to cheer me up. Yet I still can't say a damn thing. He's a single parent with no job. He has no money. I don't even have money anymore, because of him. I wouldn't be so mad if he actually did something useful for once with it. 

He treats my sibling's like perfect angels. He does anything for them. Yet, I'm here, locked in my room, again, with nothing but my window open and a bus ticket. Maybe I can bus it to where I want to go, just before I die, then maybe it won't be so bad.

I just wish I was born with a normal life, you know? With people who care about me and all that. But I wasn't. Maybe I am overreacting. Am I overreacting?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More assumptions.

If you know what's best for those around you, then don't kill yourself, it would be a shame for such a remarkable talent to go to waste.

I'm an 18 year old male attending a large state university in the US. Here I am, sitting here in April, feeling sorry for myself. This year has been miserable. I have literally made zero friends at college, this whole year. I kept telling myself, ""oh it will happen, don't worry"". Didn't happen. I live in a double by myself because my room mate left. I spend days just sitting in my room - it's hard to even get the motivation to go eat, or go to class, or study, or anything like that. 

I know I'm depressed. There's this deep underlying hatred for myself that has always been there, and would still be there even if I did have friends. That hatred exists because I wish, more than anything, I could just be a normal person. I'm bisexual, I've got some weird sexual fetishes, and it makes me want to kill myself. Not a single soul on this planet knows this. No matter what my situation, I will never be able to relate to those around me because I'm just not like them I guess...

I used to smoke weed every day because it at least helped me feel happy in my situation for a period of time, but then my dealer, the one person who I actually spoke to regularly at college, stopped dealing. Now I've just been getting wasted every night, sleeping 13 hours, and missing class. I don't know why I do this to myself. My GPA is like a 2.7 or some shit, I'm going to lose my $7k/year scholarship, and I'll have to retake 2-3 of my classes because I didn't get a good enough grade.

I want to disappear from this earth. Nothing matters. I should just kill myself already and get it overwith instead of sitting here wallowing in self misery.

I'm not meant to be in this world. I'm not capable to form any sort of relationship with another human, without disappointing them. 

I've always assumed that my time wasn't important to anyone, and I grew to accept it and thought I could just press on. However, I have formed, a type of trust with certain people, perhaps not the strongest, but as much as I can trust another individual. Obviously, I didn't have the strength to accept that, this person didn't care as much as I once believed. 

I sit here, heart somewhat broken at the loss of a friendship, that never truly existed. I would continue fighting, if this wasn't the first time I've put my trust in someone and had ripped out of my body. 

There is something wrong with me. I'm not able to hold a friendship. I reach out to my parents, and they believe nothing's wrong. The only person, I can ""talk"" to is, impossible for me to talk to now. A teacher, whom I've attempted to talk with before. But, I fear what people say. I don't want him to get hurt by me. 

Over two years ago I attempted to take my life. I knew I would never amount to anything and I stood in my kitchen, and prepared to suffocate myself. I ended up getting drunk and passing out before I could succeed. (obviously)

Today,  I sat on my bed with a razor and slit my forearm open. I ended up having an anxiety attack and fainting. I'm still here. Failed again at taking my life.

81381,,True,skootch_ginalola,,,,"As someone who is clean now (pills/coke/alcohol), but also has bipolar type 2, I know what it's like to alienate people and completely isolate yourself. I'm 32 now and my life is really good, but I started therapy at 13 and didn't kick drugs/alcohol until I was 26. And it's not easy. Even now there are days when I crave or feel so overwhelmed I can't do anything. Now I have outlets like going for runs, cleaning the house, calling a ""safe"" person. I attempted suicide twice, but you can't think of what life is like a week down the road, a month, a year. It's overwhelming, it's painful and causes anxiety. You have to find what will make you quit drugs. Some people its their kids or a spouse or their health. You find it and stick to it. And it will be very very hard, but the way you measure getting clean is just in minutes and seconds. I had an overwhelming day the other day where I had a list of things to do and was practically paralyzed in bed. So I decided the entire day, my only goal was to get up and take a shower. That's it. Take a shower to feel refreshed and clean my body and start over. So find your little moments. Even if you're still using. The fact that you RECOGNIZE a problem is a big deal. Every night before bed I want you to make a goal in your head for the next day. Not run ten miles, not check into rehab. Something like ""dust my computer monitor and keyboard"". ""Brush my teeth"". ""Change my sheets."" These are ways to self-care. Your mind and body need self-care and that still applies to small moments. Each day you have your plan. Sure, it's one item, but that item is an accomplishment that worked towards. Then over time, you maybe have two tasks. Or maybe one that involves going outside. Hell, maybe a different type of meeting or trying to go without your drug of choice for an hour. But I don't want to look forward. All I want you to do is make your daily task. If you cannot do anything that day, don't get upset, just try again the next day. And in these small moments and goals of each day you are living. That's it. Just still living. I am thinking of you.
